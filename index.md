        <p class="card-text">
          RISC-V is a standard for an instruction set architecture (ISA)
          designed for simplicity, flexibility, and scalability in computer
          processors. Unlike proprietary architectures, RISC-V offers a free and
          open standard, allowing anyone to design, manufacture, and sell RISC-V
          chips without the need for expensive licensing.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Its modular design allows for innovative extensions, making it
          suitable for a wide range of applications from embedded systems to
          high-performance computing. RISC-V's open nature fosters innovation
          and collaboration, driving its adoption in various industries and
          academia.

        <h5>Why is RISC-V important for Europe?</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">
          RISC-V holds significance for Europe due to its potential to foster
          innovation, enhance technological sovereignty, and stimulate economic
          growth within the region. By embracing RISC-V, European countries can
          reduce their dependency on foreign technologies and proprietary
          architectures, thereby enhancing their autonomy in critical sectors
          such as telecommunications, cybersecurity, and data processing.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Additionally, the open nature of RISC-V encourages collaboration and
          knowledge sharing, which can strengthen Europe's position in the
          global semiconductor industry and facilitate the development of
          tailored solutions for European needs. Furthermore, RISC-V aligns with
          Europe's push for open standards and digital sovereignty, making it an
          attractive option for research, development, and deployment across a
          wide range of applications, from IoT devices to supercomputers.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Overall, RISC-V presents an opportunity for Europe to assert its
          technological independence, drive innovation, and stimulate economic
          competitiveness in the digital age.
