## Call for technical Submissions

Taking place from June 8-12th, 2026, the RISC-V Summit Europe will
have a plenary session of keynotes, panels, and technical talks,
alongside an exhibition showcasing the latest developments across
industry and research, including demonstrations and poster
sessions. Developers, architects, technical management, enthusiasts,
business persons, and policy makers across the RISC-V ecosystem meet
together to shape the future of RISC-V computing in Europe, and
additionally serve as a bridge between continents.

The RISC-V Summit Europe covers a broad spectrum of technical areas
and domains. Attendees from industry, academia, research, SMEs, and
open source communities will come together to exchange knowledge,
ideas, technologies, and research. Therefore, the Program Committee
brings the possibility to contributors of submitting their work either
for blind or non-blind review. Submissions with a strong focus on
technical content are invited, whereas **sales or marketing pitches
are strongly discouraged in this call for submissions** (but welcome
in the exhibition). Submissions may include, but are not limited to
present:

- Timely research advances.
- Technical introduction to new technologies.
- Lessons learnt from adopting, engaging, designing, and/or developing
  RISC-V IPs (hardware or software).
- Industry vertical applications of RISC-V technologies (e.g.,
  automotive, data centers, edge-AI, IoT…).
- Technical explorations of new RISC-V based products and services
  (not marketing).
- Experiences of contributions to, or adoption of RISC-V hardware and
  software in commercial, open-source or education environments.
- Exposure of new research topics and PhD early stages.

### Topics of interest

Any submission should address one of the following RISC-V topics of interest:

- Security and functional safety 
- Energy efficiency and green computing
- High-performance computing
- Vertical application domain (e.g. Embedded systems, IoT, edge
  computing, automotive, cloud computing)
- Open-source chip design flow (hardware, processes, tools…)
- Operating system and software ecosystem
- Compilation and code optimization
- Verification and formal methods
- Systems-on-Chip, cores, RISC-V ISA extensions, accelerators,
  peripherals
- Hardware/software co-design
- RISC-V related educational activities
- Contributions/Advancements from publicly funded projects
- Spin-off experiences: from research to industry

## Submission format

The Program Committee **will accept most contributions as posters**
and some selected submissions for presentations. The submitted
extended abstracts shall be publishable standalone short papers, not
summaries for longer upcoming papers.

### Option 1: Blind Submission

Blind submissions are targeting **contributions highly related with
Research, Development, and/or innovation (R&amp;D&amp;i)**
activities. No matter whether the activity is developed by a research,
academic, or industrial institution.

Submissions for blind review must be anonymized, removing any detail
that may indicate the authors of the abstract or their
affiliation. This information can be included in the final submission
after acceptance.

Submissions should be provided as a two page extended abstract.

Templates are available
[HERE](https://github.com/riscv-europe/riscv-europe-summit-templates).

### Option 2: Non-Blind submission

Non-blind submissions are targeting contributions that are hard to
anonymize, such as technical presentations of new commercial
products/services, which contain technical insights, or presentations
of publicly funded projects. These submissions must be relevant for
tcommunity by contributing to strengthening the ecosystem, or allowing
to enable and/or foster industry adoption. Commercial marketing
contributions are very much welcome in our event but only accessible
as part of the sponsoring packages.

Submissions should be provided either as an extended abstract, up to
two pages in length, or as a short technical report tackling the
following aspects: 1. Short summary of the contribution, 2. Why is
this important for the community/industry adoption, 3. How this work
contributes to enable/foster the ecosystem, and 4. Target
audience.

Templates are available
[HERE](https://github.com/riscv-europe/riscv-europe-summit-templates).

### Submission process

The submission process is very easy: 

- Register on the platform: [*The submission platform is not yet online -- stay tuned!*]
- Click “Submit a proposal” and select Paper submission 
- Fill the mandatory information: 
    1. Authors’ information
    2. Submission’s title

    5. (Optional) Activate the check box in case your submission
       should be considered for a technical talk. Only poster by
       default
    6. (Optional) Select if you come from LMIC (Low and Medium Income
       Country). This information will be used for statistical
       purposes.
    7. Upload your contribution in pdf format (max 10&nbsp;MB)

Once registered, the information might be updated until the submission

presentations) published on the [RISC-V Europe
Summit](https://riscv-europe.org)'s web site.

The acceptance notification will be issued at least one week before
the expiration of the early-bird time. The Program Committee will ask
