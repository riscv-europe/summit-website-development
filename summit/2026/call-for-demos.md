## Call for academic demo submissions

The RISC-V Summit Europe provides a platform for universities and
research institutions to showcase their innovative research and
development outcomes through hardware and software demonstrations. The
Program Committee invites universities, research institutions, and
individual enthusiasts of open computing architectures and solutions
to join the **RISC-V University Demo Initiative**. This event is where
academic innovation intersects with the world of RISC-V and
open-source hardware and software.

Are you using, developing, or designing on RISC-V? If the answer is
“YES!” this call is for you! No matter the domain (automotive,
robotic, consumer electronics, etc.) or the area (hardware or
software), or topic (security, operating system, virtualization,
hardware observability, tools, etc.) you are interested in, as long as
RISC-V is exploited.

The **RISC-V University Demo Initiative** offers an opportunity for
individual enthusiasts, students and researchers to present their
creativity, innovation, and activities around RISC-V! Hardware
prototypes, software demonstrations, creative applications, tools,
services, or advancing RISC-V-based IoT solutions. Commercial
companies are welcome to demonstrate their technologies through the
[sponsoring](sponsoring) packages.

Taking part in the **RISC-V University Demo Initiative** brings the
possibility of sharing knowledge with peers, industry experts, and
enthusiasts while helping to fuel enthusiasm, engage with other
members of the community, and drive RISC-V adoption across diverse
sectors.

Join us to harness the power of RISC-V and collaboratively shape the
future of computing, one inspiring demo at a time!

## Submission format

Accepted demos will be run a single day, during one coffee break and a
lunch break.

Demo sessions will be distributed in the expo area (similar as the
poster sessions). Instead of having one specific area for all demos,
this year the accepted ones will have their own spot to run the
demo. The distribution on the floorplan will be announced a few days
before the event. The organization will provide one table, one back
panel for a poster, and a power outlet for connecting material.

Just as for posters, the demo’s abstract and poster will be publihsed
on the RISC-V Summit Europe web site after the event.

### Abstract and Video

The submission shall include a 250 words max. clear and concise
abstract describing the demonstration and its relevance to the RISC-V
ecosystem, and a publicly accessible short video (3 min. or less) of
your proposed demonstration.

## Important dates and instructions for submission

### Important dates

- Demo submission deadline: **March 2nd, 2026**, [AOE (Anywhere on
  Earth)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth).
- Author notification: **From April 17th to 24th, 2026**. *Not all the
  notifications will be sent at the same time.*
- Final abstract and demo details deadline: **May 29th, 2026**.
- RISC-V Summit Europe: **June 8th-12th, 2026**, in Bologna.

### **Demo Submission**

The submission process is very easy:
- Register on the platform:
  [`cfp.riscv-europe.org/eu-summit-2026/cfp`](https://cfp.riscv-europe.org/eu-summit-2026/cfp).
- Click **Submit a proposal** and select **Demo submission**
- Fill the mandatory information:
    1. Authors’ information
    2. Demo’s title
    3. Abstract (max 250 words)
    4. (Optional) Select if you come from [LMIC (Low and Medium Income
       Country)](media/pdf/lic-mlic.pdf). This information will be
       used for statistical purposes.
    5. Share a link to a publicly accessible short video (3 min. or
       less) of your proposed demonstration. A high quality video is
       not required, but it must be clear enough to let the Program
       Committee understand its maturity and contribution.

Once registered, the information might be updated until the submission
deadline. After that date, no modifications will be allowed, except on
the authors’ information (for notification purposes).

## Acceptance

Please note that accepted demos must have at least one of the authors
registered at the event to be presented and have their material
(description and recording demo) published on the web.

The acceptance notification will be issued at least one week before
the expiration of the early-bird time. The Program Committee will ask
for the final description before the event to confirm acceptance at
the according deadlines.

Only live demonstrations will be shown at the expo area. No
pre-recorded demos will be allowed during the event.
