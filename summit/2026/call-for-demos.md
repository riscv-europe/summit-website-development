The RISC-V Summit Europe provides **a platform to universities and
research institutions to showcase their innovative research and
development outcomes** through hardware and software
demonstrations. The Program Committee invites universities, research
institutions, and those enthusiastic about open computing
architectures and solutions, to join the *RISC-V University Demo
call*. An event where academic innovation intersects with the world of
RISC-V and open-source hardware and software.

Are you using, developing, or designing on RISC-V? If the answer is
“YES!” This call is for you! No matter the domain (automotive,
robotic, consumer electronics…) neither the area (hardware or
software) or topic (security, operating system, virtualization,
hardware observability, tools…) you are interested in whether RISC-V
is exploited.

With more than 600 participants and around 100 posters in each of the
previous events, we are confident that this year’s edition will be a
great event. Join us!

## Call for Demo Submissions

The **RISC-V University Demo Initiative** offers an opportunity for
students and researchers to present their creativity, innovation and
activities around RISC-V! Hardware prototypes, software
demonstrations, creative applications, tools, services, or advancing
RISC-V-based IoT solutions… We are eager to know more and see your
contributions!

Taking part in RISC-V University Demo Initiative brings the
possibility of sharing knowledge with peers, industry experts, and
enthusiasts while helping to fuel enthusiasm, engage with other
members of the community, and drive RISC-V adoption across diverse
sectors.

Join us to harness the power of RISC-V and collaboratively shape the
future of computing, one inspiring demo at a time!

## Important dates and instructions for submission

### Important dates

- Demo deadline: **March 2nd,** 2026, [AOE (Anywhere on
  Earth)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth).
- Author notification: **From April 17th to 24th**, 2026. - *Not all
  the notifications will be sent at the same time.*
- Final abstract, poster, and slides deadline: **May 29th**, 2026.
- RISC-V Summit Europe: **June 8th-12th**, 2026, in Bologna.

### Submission process

The submission process is very easy: 

- Register on the platform: [*The submission platform is not yet online -- stay tuned!*]
- Click “Submit a proposal” and select **Demo submission**
- Fill the mandatory information: 
    1. Authors’ information
    2. Demo’s title
    3. Abstract (max 250 words)
    6. (Optional) Select if you come from LMIC (Low and Medium Income
       Country). This information will be used for statistical
       purposes.
    7. Share a link to a publicly accessible short video (3 min. or
       less) of your proposed demonstration.  A high quality video is
       not required, but it must be clear enough to let the Program
       Committee understand its maturity and contribution.

Once registered, the information might be updated until the submission
deadline. After that date, no modifications will be allowed, except on
the authors' information (for notification purposes).

## Acceptance

Please, bear in mind that accepted demos must have, at least, one of
the authors registered at the event to be presented and having their
material (description, and recording demo) published on the web.

The acceptance notification will be issued at least one week before
the expiration of the early-bird time. The Program Committee will ask
for the final description before the event to confirm acceptance at
the according deadlines.

Only live demonstrations will be shown at the expo area. No
pre-recorded demo will be allowed during the event.

## Demo format

Accepted demos will be run a single day, during one coffee break and a
lunch break.

Demo sessions will be distributed in the expo area (similar as the
poster sessions). Instead of having one specific area for all demos,
this year the accepted ones will have their own spot to run the demo.
The distribution on the floorplan will be announced a few days before
the event. The organization will provide one table, one back panel for
a poster, and a power outlet for connecting material.

Just as for posters, the demo's abstract and poster will be publihsed
on the RISC-V Summit Europe web site after the event.
