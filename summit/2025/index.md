[RISC-V](https://riscv.org), the open standard [instruction set
architecture
(ISA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture), is
enabling a range of new applications and research that will define the
future of computing in Europe. The region has been central to RISC-V's
success, with one-third of RISC-V's global community based in Europe.

**RISC-V Summit Europe** takes place in **Paris** from **Monday 12th to
Thursday 15th May, 2025**. The combination of strong industrial and
academic communities is key to the success of RISC-V in Europe, and
for this reason the conference is designed to help attendees to
explore both commercial and research applications.  *RISC-V Summit
Europe* is an opportunity not to be missed. Come to Paris to be part
of the new wave of European computing innovation!
