Unlike previous years in [Barcelona (June
2013)](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2023/side-events) and [Munich
(June 2024)](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2024/sideevents), there
will be no side events directly following the RISC-V Summit Europe on
Friday this year.

For RISC-V projects or open hardware communities that would like to
piggyback on the Summit and have a productive Friday, INRIA has
several meeting rooms available at [48 rue Barrault, 75013
Paris](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/48.826311/2.346010).
