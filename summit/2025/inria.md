There will be no *Side events* directly following the *RISC-V Summit
Europe* on Friday this year, as was in Barcelona (June 2013) and
Munich (June 2024)

For projects, RISC-V or open hardware communities that would want to
piggy-back on the Summit and have a productive Friday, INRIA has a
number of meeting rooms available located [48 rue Barrault, 75013
Paris](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/48.826311/2.346010).

For any further information, please get in in touch with John Doe at
