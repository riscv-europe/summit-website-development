We’re inviting universities and research institutions enthusiastic
about RISC-V to join our **RISC-V University Demo Day**, an event
where academic innovation intersects with the world of RISC-V and
open-source hardware and software.

RISC-V has risen as a leading architecture, delivering unmatched
flexibility, scalability, and openness. Across Europe, universities
and research institutions have led the charge in RISC-V exploration,
pioneering transformative advancements poised to redefine the future
of computing.

This demo day offers you a platform to present your state-of-the-art
RISC-V research, whether through hardware prototypes, software
demonstrations, or creative applications. From developing innovative
RISC-V processor designs to enhancing software ecosystems for RISC-V
systems or advancing RISC-V-based IoT solutions, we’re eager to see
your contributions!

By taking part in the **RISC-V University Demo Day**, you’ll share
your work with peers, industry experts, and enthusiasts while helping
to fuel enthusiasm and drive RISC-V adoption across diverse sectors.

Join us to harness the power of RISC-V and collaboratively shape the
future of computing, one inspiring demo at a time!

## Important dates
- Deadline for submissions is **Friday, April 25th** (was ~~Monday,
  April 7th~~), <a class="summit"
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth">AOE (Anywhere
  on Earth)</a>.
- Notification of accepted demos will be sent starting on Monday,
  April 14th, and will continue until Friday, May 2nd.

### Guidelines

- The university demo day is limited to universities and research
  institutions, worldwide.
- Demonstrators can be results from joint projects with industry, but
  the focus must be clearly on the academic partner(s).
- Presentations are limited to an overview slide.
- The actual demo should showcase your great results, either around a
  chip, FPGA or software.
- Viewers should understand the relevance of your demonstrator to the
  growing RISC-V ecosystem.
- if selected, the demo will have a 10 min. time slot.

### Submission

To create the best experience of this unique opportunity, we require
you to provide a short description and share a brief video of your
proposed demonstration. This does not have to be of very high quality
and be the final demonstration, but it is important for us to
understand maturity of the demonstrator and the learning from your
demonstration. Just use your powerful smartphone to show us what you
plan to present!
