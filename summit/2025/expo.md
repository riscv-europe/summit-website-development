RISC-V Summit Europe will have a large exhibition area on three
levels, where our sponsors' stands, the poster presentations and some
rest areas will be spread out. Breaks and lunches will be served in
several places in these three areas.  The overall layout will
encourage networking by allowing maximum interaction between all
summit participants

From Tuesday 13 noon until Wednesday 14 afternoon, during breaks and
lunches, a 200-seat amphitheatre will be dedicated to demos and
product presentations from our sponsors.

On Thursday 15, the same amphitheatre will be used to present results
and demos from academic RISC-V research projects.
