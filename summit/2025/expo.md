RISC-V Summit Europe will have a large exhibition area on three
levels, where our sponsors' stands, the poster presentations and some
rest areas will be spread out. Breaks and lunches will be served in
several places.

The overall layout will encourage networking by allowing maximum
interaction between all summit participants
