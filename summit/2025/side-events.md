Unlike previous *Summits Europe* in [Barcelona (June
2013)](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2023/side-events) and [Munich
(June 2024)](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2024/sideevents), this
year the *Friday Side Events* will not be hosted at the main
venue of the *RISC-V Summit Europe*.

RISC-V projects or open hardware communities interested in concluding
the RISC-V Summit Europe with a productive Friday can look into the
following options:

 - Contact nearby hotels to check availability of meeting rooms for
   Friday 16 May, e.g. those mentioned in the [Venue &
   Accommodation](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2025/venue) page.

 - For meetings of 14 people or less, you may rent a meeting room at
   [FIAP Paris](https://www.fiap.paris/en). FIAP Paris offers
   facilities and accommodation to host meetings at their premises
   located at [30 rue Cabanis, 75014
   Paris](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xgC3pgiuuqeUmN3S6). For further
   information on pricing and conditions, please contact [Ms Emma
   Nezondet](mailto:nezondet@fiap.fr?subject=Meeting room for a RISC-V
   Side Event on Fri 16 May) directly.

If you have organized a side event, and want it to be annouced on this
page, please get in touch with the RISC-V Summit Europe 2025 [Local
Committee](mailto:europe-summit-planning@riscv.org).

*An earlier version of this page suggested INRIA's Paris premises as a
potential venue for Side Events. However, upon review of initial
events requests, it has been determined that these facilities do not
meet necessary requirements. Consequently, FIAP and nearby hotels have
been identified as a more appropriate location for hosting workshops
and meetings on Friday 16 May.*
