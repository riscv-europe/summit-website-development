Unlike previous years in [Barcelona (June
2013)](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2023/side-events) and [Munich
(June 2024)](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2024/sideevents), this
year the *Friday Side Events* will not be hosted hosted at the main
venue of the *RISC-V Summit Europe*.

[INRIA](https://www.inria.fr) has several meeting rooms at [48 rue
Barrault, 75013
Paris](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/48.826311/2.346010) that
are available to RISC-V projects or open hardware communities that
want to close the *RISC-V Summit Europe* with a productive Friday.

To organize a side event on Friday 16th at [INRIA
Paris](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris), get in touch
with [Ms Jennifer Bourdon](mailto:jennifer.bourdon@inria.fr?subject=RISC-V Summit Europe Side Event).
