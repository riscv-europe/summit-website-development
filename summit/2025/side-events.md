Unlike previous *Summits Europe* in [Barcelona (June
2013)](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2023/side-events) and [Munich
(June 2024)](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2024/sideevents), this
year the *Friday Side Events* will not be hosted hosted at the main
venue of the *RISC-V Summit Europe*.

[FIAP PAris](https://www.fiap.paris/en) can host meetings for at [30
rue Cabanis, 75014
Paris](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9eu4mjzJj6SJTqha9). This allows for
RISC-V projects or open hardware communities to close the *RISC-V
Summit Europe* with a productive Friday.

To organize a side event on Friday 16th at [FIAP
Paris](https://www.fiap.paris/en), get in touch with [Ms Emma
Nezondet](mailto:nezondet@fiap.fr?subject=Booking for a RISC-V Side
Event on Fri 16 May).

*The earlier version of this page suggested INRIA's Paris premises as
a potential venue for Side Events. However, upon review, it has been
determined that these facilities do not meet the requirements outlined
in the initial events requests. Consequently, FIAP has been identified
as a more appropriate location for hosting workshops and meetings.*
