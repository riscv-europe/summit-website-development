Unlike previous *Summits Europe* in [Barcelona (June
2013)](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2023/side-events) and [Munich
(June 2024)](https://riscv-europe.org/summit/2024/sideevents), this
year the *Friday Side Events* will not be hosted at the main
venue of the *RISC-V Summit Europe*.

[FIAP Paris](https://www.fiap.paris/en) can host meetings at [30 rue
Cabanis, 75014
Paris](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xgC3pgiuuqeUmN3S6). This
allows for RISC-V projects or open hardware communities to close the
*RISC-V Summit Europe* with a productive Friday.

To organize a *Side Event* on Friday May, 16th, get in touch directly with [Ms
Emma Nezondet](mailto:nezondet@fiap.fr?subject=Meeting room for a RISC-V Side Event on Fri 16 May)
from [FIAP Paris](https://www.fiap.paris/en).

*An earlier version of this page suggested INRIA's Paris premises as
a potential venue for Side Events. However, upon review of initial
events requests, it has been determined that these facilities do not
meet necessary requirements. Consequently, FIAP has been identified
as a more appropriate location for hosting workshops and meetings on
Friday 16 May.*
