# Call for Submissions

RISC-V Summit Europe brings together developers, architects, technical
management, business persons and policy makers from across the RISC-V
ecosystem. Attendees from industry, academia, research, SMEs, and open
source communities will come together to exchange knowledge, ideas,
technologies, and research, shaping the future of RISC-V computing in
Europe.

Taking place from 12-15 May 2025, in Paris (France), the event will
have a single track of keynotes, invited and selected talks, alongside
an exhibition showcasing the latest developments across industry and
research, including technology demonstrations and poster sessions.

Submissions with a strong focus on technical content are invited,
outlining for example:

- Timely research advances.
- Success stories.
- Technical introduction to new technologies.
- Experiences of contributions to, or adoption of RISC-V hardware and
  software in commercial, open-source or education environments.
- Exposure of new research topics and PhD early stages.

Contributions may be submitted either for blind or non-blind
review. The preferred review method is blind review. Non-blind should
be left to contributions that are hard to anonymize, such as technical
presentations of new commercial products or presentations of publicly
funded projects. Any question whether a submission should apply to
blind or non-blind review should be asked to the PC chairs at
[riscv-europe2025_pc@softconf.com](mailto:riscv-europe2025_pc@softconf.com)
before submitting. Please note, an abstract may not be submitted to
both review methods.

# Important dates:

- Abstract submission deadline: Monday, January 27th, 2025, [AOE
  (Anywhere on
  Earth)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth). No
  extensions.
- Author notification: Monday, March 7th, 2025.
- Final abstract PDF and slides deadline: Thursday, April 15th, 2025.
- Poster PDF deadline: May 5th, 2025.
- RISC-V Summit Europe: May 12th-15th, 2025, Paris.

The accepted authors will have to get a paid registration (or a
registration included in a sponsor package). The acceptance
notification will be issued at least one week before the expiration of
the early-bird time.

The Steering Committee aims to provide a limited budget for
stipends. More information will be available on the conference website
before the submission deadline.

# Topics of interest:

We invite submissions related to RISC-V addressing the following
technical topics of interest:

- Security and functional safety 
- Energy efficiency and green computing
- High-performance computing
- Embedded systems, IoT, edge computing
- Automotive
- Cloud computing
- Open-source hardware and open silicon
- Operating system and software ecosystem
- Compilation and code optimization
- Open EDA tools
- Verification and formal methods
- Systems-on-Chip, cores, RISC-V ISA extensions, accelerators,
  peripherals
- Hardware/software co-design
- RISC-V related educational activities
- Technical presentations around development of new commercial
  products
- Technical presentations for new applications
- Technical success stories
- Policies, strategies, business and industry trends
- Overview presentations of publicly funded projects
- Spin-off experiences: from research to industry
- Important announcements related to RISC-V
- Any other topic related to RISC-V and open stack (hardware or
  software)

# Submission Format:

Submissions should be provided as a two page extended
abstract. Abstract template and instructions for submission will be
available on the Summit website at
[https://riscv-europe.org](https://riscv-europe.org).

Contributions may be submitted for blind (recommended) or non-blind
review. Submissions for blind review must be anonymized, removing any
detail that may indicate the authors of the abstract or their
affiliation. This information can be included in the final submission
after acceptance. Non-blind review must only be used for contributions
that are hard to anonymize, such as technical presentations of new
commercial products or presentations of publicly funded
projects. These submissions should highlight product RISC-V markets,
policies, strategies, business and industry trends, or present
publicly funded projects of interest to the RISC-V and open hardware
community.

Sales or marketing pitches are welcome in the exhibition but are
strongly discouraged in this call for submissions.

The committee will accept most contributions as posters and some
selected submissions for short or long presentations. The submitted
extended abstracts shall be publishable standalone short papers, not
summaries for longer upcoming papers.

Accepted abstracts, slides, and posters will be published on the event
page, together with presentations, which will be recorded. The Program
Committee will ask for the poster/presentation before the event to
confirm acceptance at the according deadlines.
