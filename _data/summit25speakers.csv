SponsorDemo,,OnHold,PhD,Stefano,Di Matteo,CEA ,stefano.dimatteo@cea.fr,"Research Engineer, Ph.D.",VASCO: ASIC Test Platform for Cybersecurity on FD-SOI,"As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, hardware security has become a critical issue in the design of electronic devices. The advent of quantum computing has forced standardization bodies to rethink cryptographic foundations, leading to the rise of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) as a strategic priority. At the same time, the RISC-V open-source instruction set architecture is emerging as a key enabler of secure hardware, offering new opportunities to design intrinsically secure microarchitectures. To address these research opportunities, CEA has developed VASCO, an ASIC platform designed to innovate, implement and characterize secure hardware primitives. It supports the development of robust countermeasures against side-channel attacks, fault injection and other physical security threats. In addition, VASCO Is adopted for characterization of security primitives such as True Random Numbers Generators (TRNGs) and Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). VASCO focuses also on PQC, which requires specialized hardware accelerators to achieve efficient and secure implementations. This demo will present the latest advancements made with VASCO#2, which was fabricated in 2022. Furthermore, the demo will offer a preview of VASCO#3, which will be taped-out in 2025.
