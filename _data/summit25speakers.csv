SponsorDemo,,OnHold,PhD,Stefano,Di Matteo,stefano.dimatteo@cea.fr,CEA ,"Research Engineer, Ph.D.",VASCO: ASIC Test Platform for Cybersecurity on FD-SOI,"As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, hardware security has become a critical issue in the design of electronic devices. The advent of quantum computing has forced standardization bodies to rethink cryptographic foundations, leading to the rise of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) as a strategic priority. At the same time, the RISC-V open-source instruction set architecture is emerging as a key enabler of secure hardware, offering new opportunities to design intrinsically secure microarchitectures.

To address these research opportunities, CEA has developed VASCO, an ASIC platform designed to innovate, implement and characterize secure hardware primitives. It supports the development of robust countermeasures against side-channel attacks, fault injection and other physical security threats. In addition, VASCO Is adopted for characterization of security primitives such as True Random Numbers Generators (TRNGs) and Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). VASCO focuses also on PQC, which requires specialized hardware accelerators to achieve efficient and secure implementations. This demo will present the latest advancements made with VASCO#2, which was fabricated in 2022. Furthermore, the demo will offer a preview of VASCO#3, which will be taped-out in 2025. With an enhanced set of features, VASCO#3 will further extend the platform’s ability to anticipate and mitigate emerging cybersecurity threats.","Stefano Di Matteo got his master and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Pisa respectively in 2019 and 2023. Currently, he is junior chair in hardware implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography at CEA in Grenoble. His research interests include hardware implementation of PQC with countermeasures against physical attacks, RISC-V architectures and Instruction Set Extensions for PQC. He contributed to multiple European-funded projects such as European Processor Initiative (SGA1 and SGA2), TEXTAROSSA and AREO, and he has co-authored over 20 publications on hardware implementation of cryptographic algorithms. He supervises Ph.D. and master’s students at CEA.",,DiMatteo.jpeg

SponsorDemo,,OnHold,PhD,Devan,Sharla,devan.sharma@siemens.com,Siemens,Account Technology Manager(EMEAI),RISC-V on-chip debug & trace solution: Tessent UltraSight-V,"Modern applications demand increased compute power resulting in exponential increase in design complexity. These complex RISC-V based SoCs can’t rely on traditional way of debugging, requiring an efficient way of debugging & tracing. In this presentation, we will unveil Tessent UltraSight-V, an end-to-end solution consisting of embedded IP and software designed to provide comprehensive, efficient debugging and trace capabilities that integrates with industry standard tool to further empower embedded software engineers in developing high-performance embedded software. The integration of Tessent UltraSight-V on-chip IP modules and host software empowers engineers to efficiently diagnose the root causes of unexpected behaviour and underperformance. Utilizing effective, non-intrusive techniques such as encoded processor trace based on the Efficient Trace (E-trace) standard, logging, high-speed interfaces (USB 2.0) and DMA for fast code uploads, this solution minimizes debugging delays and accelerates your SoC projects, ensuring they meet their market deadlines.","Devan holds a master’s degree in digital systems design as well as a post graduate diploma in VLSI technology. Devan spent many years on the technical side, where he designed products which involved writing code in VHDL, Verilog-C and assembler. He was involved in overall FPGA designs vastly experienced working for/with both Altera and Xilinx products.

 

Over the past 15 years, Devan made successful transition into technical sales, held several customer-facing commercial roles in various capacities. Most recently, Devan was responsible for sales of XMOS products in EMEA territory.",,Devan.jpg
