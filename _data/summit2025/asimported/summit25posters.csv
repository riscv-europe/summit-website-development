"3","3X-P5F6B5B8E4","Agile Formal Verification with Symbolic Quick Error Detection by Semantically Equivalent Program Execution","Yufeng Li, Qiusong Yang, Yiwei Ci, Enyuan Tian, Yungang Bao and Kan Shi","Double-blind review","Borja Perez; Olivier Sentieys","Accept as poster","","As processor complexity continues to grow and development cycles shorten, agile development becomes essential. Formal verification ensures design correctness but is labor-intensive and error-prone due to design-specific properties. Symbolic Quick Error Detection (SQED) avoids manually writing many properties by checking the design-independent, self-consistency universal property, thereby facilitating agile verification. However, since self-consistency is based on assertions that expect the processor to produce consistent results between the original and duplicate instructions, it fails to cover bugs that affect both the original and duplicate instructions, leading to false positives. To address this,
we propose Symbolic Quick Error Detection by Semantically Equivalent Program Execution (SEPE-SQED), which utilizes program synthesis to find programs (instruction sequences) with equivalent meanings to original instructions. SEPE-SQED effectively detects the bugs missed by SQED by differentiating their impact on the original instruction and its semantically equivalent program. In the case study of a RISC-V processor, agile formal verification can improve productivity by approximately 60 times compared to conventional Formal Property Verification (FPV).","20 Jan 2025 07:12:53","20 Jan 2025 07:12:53","Double-blind review","","crazybinary","Yufeng","","Li","crazybinary494@gmail.com","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","","Qiusong","","Yang","qiusong@iscas.ac.cn","Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","","Yiwei","","Ci","yiwei@iscas.ac.cn","Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","","Enyuan","","Tian","tianenyuan@nfs.iscas.ac.cn","Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","","Yungang","","Bao","baoyg@ict.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","","Kan","","Shi","shikan@ict.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","crazybinary","","Yufeng","","Li","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","","","","","","crazybinary494@gmail.com","","Beijing","Beijing","","CN","China","","Yufeng Li (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences); Qiusong Yang (Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences); Yiwei Ci (Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences); Enyuan Tian (Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences); Yungang Bao (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences); Kan Shi (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences)","crazybinary494@gmail.com; qiusong@iscas.ac.cn; yiwei@iscas.ac.cn; tianenyuan@nfs.iscas.ac.cn; baoyg@ict.ac.cn; shikan@ict.ac.cn","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Pulp-Lite uses low latency interconnections to connect the CPUs and data memory, which is shared by all CPUs. By introducing a novel address mapping mechanism, the average response latency of the interconnections can be further reduced, which can improve the performance of this multi-core up to 6.9%. We have also implemented a lightweight multi-core programming framework for this multi-core, using CPU0 of the 8 CPUs to manage the other CPUs and peripherals. Programs running on CPU0 allocate tasks to other cores through simple function calls rather than complex inter-thread communication. An FPGA implementation of multi-core with 8 RI5CY cores is evaluated for its performance and resource footprint. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-core achieves a speedup ratio of 6X-7.8X for various machine learning algorithms, such as CNN, KNN, NB, SVM, and LR. The influences of different interconnection topologies, multi-core scheduling methods, as well as stack organizations are evaluated and discussed in detail. Compared to GAP8, our multi-core is up to 21.7% faster under the same ISA, compiler and clock configurations.","23 Jan 2025 12:21:41","23 Jan 2025 12:21:41","Double-blind review","","patrickyang","Yang","","Yong","yy@wch.cn","Nanjing Qinheng Microelectronics Co., Ltd.","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","patrickyang","","Yang","","Yong","Nanjing Qinheng Microelectronics Co., Ltd.","","","","","","yy@wch.cn","","Nanjing","Jiangsu","","CN","China","","Yang Yong (Nanjing Qinheng Microelectronics Co., Ltd.)","yy@wch.cn","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

FIAs can compromise an embedded processor by altering its clock signal, power supply or by using electromagnetic pulses. 
This study focuses on analyzing the impact of FIA on the Physical Memory Protection (PMP) configuration flow within a CVA6 RISC-V core.
We conducted fault injection campaigns on an FPGA implementation using an ARTY A7-100T board to characterize the resulting fault effects.  
To achieve this, we utilized clock glitches as the primary method of fault injection.  
Our experimental findings reveal that FIAs can induce various effects on PMP configuration registers.

"8","8X-A2D5F3E5C4","SAIL-RISCV Memory Model Refactor","Mingzhu Yan, Shuo Huang, Jian Guan and Yunxiang Luo","Double-blind review","Borja Perez; Olivier Sentieys","Reject","","Sail-RISCV has been identified as the optimal model for the RISC-V ISA. However, it is important to note that the memory model of Sail-RISCV is subject to two primary limitations. Firstly, there is an absence of 34-bit physical address support in RV32, and secondly, there is ambiguity between physical and virtual memory. To address these deficiencies, a reconstruction of the Sail-RISCV memory model has been undertaken. Specifically, we employed new type constructs to distinguish physical and virtual memory, and enabled 34-bit physical address support by allowing arbitrary-width address mappings to Sail-supported address types. We refined the communication mechanism with Sail's simulated memory to accommodate arbitrary-width physical addresses, which are then mapped to corresponding Sail memory model addresses. Through experimentation, involving varying address widths, we validated the efficacy of this approach, demonstrating its correct handling of 34-bit addresses. The results of the study indicated enhanced type safety and improved model accuracy. A comparison of our implementation with alternative methods demonstrated that it offers greater flexibility, reducing the coupling risk between physical and virtual memory and providing a more precise memory abstraction for the Sail-RISCV model. For example, utilizing new type constructs ensures compile-time memory type safety. Experimental results confirmed our success in resolving type-safety concerns and extending Sail-RISCV's support for 34-bit physical addresses. This enhancement, we believe, strengthens the accuracy of Sail-RISCV as a golden model for RISC-V.","26 Jan 2025 01:21:42","26 Jan 2025 01:21:42","Double-blind review","","yanmingzhu","Mingzhu","","Yan","yanmingzhu@iscas.ac.cn","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","No","","Shuo","","Huang","huangshuo4@gmail.com","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","No","","Jian","","Guan","guanjian@stu.cdut.edu.cn","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab (PLCT), Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","No","","Yunxiang","","Luo","luoyunxiang@iscas.ac.cn","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab (PLCT), Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yanmingzhu","","Mingzhu","","Yan","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","","","","","","yanmingzhu@iscas.ac.cn","","Beijing","Beijing","","CN","China","","Mingzhu Yan (Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)); Shuo Huang (Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)); Jian Guan (Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab (PLCT), Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)); Yunxiang Luo (Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab (PLCT), Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS))","yanmingzhu@iscas.ac.cn; huangshuo4@gmail.com; guanjian@stu.cdut.edu.cn; luoyunxiang@iscas.ac.cn","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

However, the introduction of vendor-defined extensions has the potential to lead to fragmentation, creating challenges for developers in managing toolchains and adapting software. This paper presents RuyiSDK which is a comprehensive solution tailored for RISC-V developers. It is designed to address these challenges by integrating existing foundational software, promoting the adaptation of unsupported applications, and cultivating a vibrant developer community. RuyiSDK offers a package index that consolidates toolchains, emulators, and more, along with profile files that describe how to perform cross-platform builds, as well as software and RISC-V boards co-development. A key component of RuyiSDK is the Package Manager, which not only inherits the capabilities of traditional package managers but also incorporates advanced features such as virtual environment creation, device provisioning, and plugin support. The Package Manager transparently applies virtual environment profiles to the corresponding toolchains by reading the package index. Users only need to specify the target development board, without needing to manage toolchain differences manually. The device provisioning feature provides interactive guidance for keeping system images up to date for specific development boards, while test reports offer a certain level of quality assurance.

"13","13X-A3C9B5E3F2","Design of JESD204C scrambler verification using RISC-V processor","Veena Srinivas Chakravarthi, Ponni Mohanakumari, Sreenath Manikkara, Sai Pavan Maligaveli and Ilker Demirel","Double-blind review","Borja Perez; Olivier Sentieys","Reject","","The design and verification of digital communication systems, particularly the design blocks which are based on polynomial implementations such as CRC, FCS and scramblers, are critical to ensuring data integrity and security in any communication protocols. Scramblers are widely used to randomize data streams, reducing the probability of long sequences of identical bits and minimizing electromagnetic interference. Verifying such blocks is always a challenge as the data passing through them changes every clock and having a good verification model is critical to the successful verification of the data path in communication systems.  This paper presents the design and implementation of a scrambler verification model using a RISC-V processor taking JESD204C as an example design, leveraging RISC-V's open-source architecture and flexibility for custom hardware-software co-design. The soft scrambler verification model proposed here is very flexible and can easily be customised to any polynomial and seed values for verifying communication system of any protocol. 

The proposed model integrates a software-based scrambler algorithm with a hardware-accelerated RISC-V processor to achieve efficient and scalable verification. The scrambler algorithm is implemented in C and executed on the RISC-V processor, while the hardware is a synthesizable design which can be ported onto a FPGA. The RISC-V processor is chosen for its modularity, extensibility, and ability to support custom instructions, which are utilized to optimize the scrambler's performance.

The verification model is designed to validate the functionality of the scrambler by comparing its output against a golden reference model. Test vectors are generated to cover various edge cases, including all-zero and all-one sequences, as well as pseudo-random data streams. The model also incorporates error injection techniques to evaluate the scrambler's robustness in the presence of bit errors.

The implementation is carried out using a RISC-V core, with the scrambler algorithm running in software. The design is verified using a combination of simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing to ensure accuracy and reliability. Results demonstrate the functional correctness, making it suitable for real-time applications.

This work highlights the advantages of using RISC-V processors for hardware-software co-design in communication systems. The open-source nature of RISC-V allows for customization and optimization, while the integration of software and hardware components provides a flexible and scalable solution for scrambler verification. Future work includes extending the model to support multi-channel scramblers and integrating advanced error-correction techniques.","30 Jan 2025 05:51:32","30 Jan 2025 05:51:32","Double-blind review","","scveena","Veena","","Chakravarthi","veena.c@leadsoc.com","Leadsoc technologies private limited","No","","Ponni","","Mohanakumari","ponni.mohanakumari@leadsoc.com","Leadsoc technologies private limited","No","","Sreenath","","Manikkara","sreenath.m@leadsoc.com","Leadsoc technologies private limited","No","","Sai Pavan","","Maligaveli","saipavan.maligaveli@leadsoc.com","Leadsoc technologies private limited","No","","Ilker","","Demirel","ilker@leadsoc.com","Leadsoc technologies private limited","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","scveena","","Veena","Srinivas","Chakravarthi","Leadsoc technologies private limited","","","","","","veena.c@leadsoc.com","","Bangalore","Karnataka","","IN","India","","Veena Srinivas Chakravarthi (Leadsoc technologies private limited); Ponni Mohanakumari (Leadsoc technologies private limited); Sreenath Manikkara (Leadsoc technologies private limited); Sai Pavan Maligaveli (Leadsoc technologies private limited); Ilker Demirel (Leadsoc technologies private limited)","veena.c@leadsoc.com; ponni.mohanakumari@leadsoc.com; sreenath.m@leadsoc.com; saipavan.maligaveli@leadsoc.com; ilker@leadsoc.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Spectre-like vulnerabilities, often observed in RISC-V architectures, stem from improper implementation and transient execution, while flawed AES implementations in RISC-V systems can expose critical signals. The industry's lack of a reliable single sign-off method complicates the verification process, requiring multiple stages such as Simulation, Formal methods, and post-Silicon validation. Signing off on confidentiality is particularly challenging without verification in unknown scenarios, and early detection at the RTL stage remains elusive.

This innovative technology addresses these challenges by capturing Secure Data Transaction Intent across user-defined signals within RISC-V designs and performing static analysis to identify illegal data flows that cause security violations. By enabling early detection with minimal constraints during the RTL design phase, this approach is scalable to full SoC-sized RISC-V designs, significantly saving time and effort.","30 Jan 2025 13:06:18","4 Feb 2025 04:45:12","Double-blind review","","vsharma95","Varun","","Sharma","vsharma@realintent.com","Real Intent Inc.","No","vikas.sachdeva","Vikas","","Sachdeva","vikas.sachdev@gmail.com","Real Intent","No","vinod","Vinod","","Viswanath","vinod@realintent.com","Real Intent, Inc.","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vsharma95","","Varun","","Sharma","Real Intent Inc.","","","","","","vsharma@realintent.com","","New Delhi-110018","Delhi","","IN","India","","Varun Sharma (Real Intent Inc.); Vikas Sachdeva (Real Intent); Vinod Viswanath (Real Intent, Inc.)","vsharma@realintent.com; vikas.sachdev@gmail.com; vinod@realintent.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","Yes","None","None",

This presentation primparily introduces all security implementation required in RISC-V CoVE specification, especially those security premitives defined in SoC level. Aim to be top security level, we have a built-in RoT with security sub-system which can offer security volatile memory to store CoVE measurement used in platform remote attesation and save local attestation certificate for TSM vendor as choice.  To enhance speed in bootstrap, it provides a new cryptographic library which is optimized by using RISC-V cryptographic vector instructions. Those optimized algorithms can be used to authenticate firmware image and entity measurememt. To support management lifecycle of TVM, it needs to handle TEE ecall from Host OS/VMM or TSM and response in asynchronously. We extend a new ECALL type dedicated for CoVE. Most requests must be delivered forward to opposite OS to handle, which result in supervisor domain context switch sequently. Except to save/restore supervisor domain context, it also enforces to update MTT table before execution next. Take note that the MTT driver and other security primitive is programmed by RUST language which is popular recent years. To better utilize MTT memory, we import new memory management alogrithms for MTT memory allocation. For server platform, we might support other functionality which shall stay in machine mode to be alive at runtime, such as RAS/SCP service and other runtime service from UEFI BIOS.","3 Feb 2025 03:39:43","3 Feb 2025 03:39:43","Double-blind review","","cui_632","Cui","","Xiaoxia","cxx194832@alibaba-inc.com","Alibaba","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cui_632","","Cui","","Xiaoxia","Alibaba","","","","","","cxx194832@alibaba-inc.com","","","","","CN","China","","Cui Xiaoxia (Alibaba)","cxx194832@alibaba-inc.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Recent attacks show that they can leak sensitive information on many processors of Apple's M chip series. These attacks cannot only target conventional systems, but also secure architectures, e.g., CHERI-enhanced processors. The CHERI capability instruction-set extension promises proven architectural guarantees for memory safety and pointer provenance. However, superscalar and out-of-order CHERI implementations will need to contend with microarchitectural transient-execution side-channel attacks. To ensure the safety of all CHERI implementations, we articulate CSC: a universal architectural speculation contract for the CHERI architecture that maintains key capability invariants in speculation. We then develop tests against sub-classes of CSC, and discover violations in CHERI-Toooba that lead to a new class of transient-execution attacks. We then develop strategies to fully enforce CSC in CHERI-Toooba. We find that simplistic, strong enforcement incurs a low performance overhead of only 3.43\% in SPECint2006 benchmarks, with promise for more optimal designs in the future.","3 Feb 2025 17:17:40","7 Feb 2025 10:37:01","Double-blind review","","faf28","Franz","","Fuchs","franz.fuchs@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","Jonathan","","Woodruff","jonathan.woodruff@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","Peter","","Rugg","peter.rugg@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","Alexandre","","Joannou","alexandre.joannou@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","Simon","","Moore","simon.moore@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","faf28","","Franz","A.","Fuchs","University of Cambridge","","","","","","franz.fuchs@cl.cam.ac.uk","","","","","GB","United Kingdom","","Franz A.

Heart of this processor is a processing pipeline which is realized via AXI streaming. It is able to process multiple instruction streams, each of which is represented by a thread token containing a program counter and a thread identifier which selects the associated register set. Thread tokens enter the pipeline at the input and are emitted at the output with modified program counter. Instruction and data memories are accessed via streaming interfaces at the side of the pipeline. Inside the processor the processing pipeline, thread handling infrastructure and a token fifo form a closed ring in which the thread tokens circulate. The ring enables monitoring and manipulation of the thread tokens and provides resources for connecting high-level debuggers. An example system even suited for small FPGAs is presented that consists of the processor with block ram, Wishbone bus and some peripherals.

The WorldGuard security model offers a promising approach, yet few SoCs currently implement it.

To address this, we open-sourced Vyond, a configurable WorldGuard implementation within Chipyard, enabling agile and adaptable security prototyping. We demonstrate how WorldGuard components integrate seamlessly into a Rocket SoC using Chipyard's parameterized framework. Additionally, Vyond provides three WorldGuard-enabled hardware implementations (Simulation, FPGA, and QEMU) and a baseline security monitor, allowing designers to rapidly implement a secure OS, test functionalities, and evaluate hardware costs. We anticipate that Vyond will accelerate RISC-V security research and drive innovation in hardware security architectures.","5 Feb 2025 00:32:18","5 Feb 2025 00:32:18","Non-blind review","","sk84.kim","Sungkeun","","Kim","sk84.kim@samsung.com","Samsung Research","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","sk84.kim","","Sungkeun","","Kim","Samsung Research","","","","","","sk84.kim@samsung.com","","Seoul","","","KR","Republic of Korea","","Sungkeun Kim (Samsung Research)","sk84.kim@samsung.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

As the official testing tool used for ACT testing, RISCOF can leverage the Sail-RISCV model as a reference to check whether the tested model conforms to the specification. However, the ACT test repository used by RISCOF lacks support for many test instructions and extensions, including several test cases for the zfh extension, such as `fcvt.d.h`. Therefore, we will add new test instruction support to RISCOF to address this issue.

RISCOF relies on multiple testing tools for test development. These include RISCV-CTG for generating test cases and RISCV-ISAC for coverage testing. To support new test instructions, we need to add YAML nodes for the test instructions in RISC-V CTG to define them and write corresponding CGF files for the instructions. Next, we will add the relevant instruction checks to the decoder in ISAC to support the coverage detection of the new instructions. Afterward, we will run RISCOF with the generated test cases, and the results will show that the test outcomes are accurate.

By adding support for test instructions to ACT via RISCOF, we can provide greater flexibility for testing, further advancing the comprehensiveness and accuracy of ACT testing.","5 Feb 2025 19:53:09","5 Feb 2025 19:53:09","Double-blind review","","zhuxuchang","Zhu","","Xu Chang","zhuxuchang@iscas.ac.cn","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab","No","luoyunxiang","Yunxiang","","Luo","luoyunxiang@iscas.ac.cn","The Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","zhuxuchang","","Zhu","","Xu Chang","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab","","","","","","zhuxuchang@iscas.ac.cn","","Wu Han","Hu Bei","","CN","China","","Zhu Xu Chang (Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab); Yunxiang Luo (The Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS))","zhuxuchang@iscas.ac.cn; luoyunxiang@iscas.ac.cn","","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

As the interface between high-level programs and low-level chip execution, the assembly instruction set plays a critical role in optimization and often becomes both a bottleneck and a breakthrough point in the process. RISC-V offers unique advantages in this area: it is an open-source instruction set, highly scalable, and has special support for vector computations. Therefore, leveraging the deployment environment of AI models can accelerate the development of the RISC-V ecosystem.Now, it is essential to raise awareness about the unique advantages of the RISC-V instruction set.First, we will promote the characteristics of RISC-V to the student community through various channels. By taking advantage of students' enthusiasm for following trends, we will integrate modern online elements into video production to lower the learning threshold and increase engagement. These videos will be widely disseminated through social platforms and online education channels, quickly attracting student attention.Next, as students' interest in the RISC-V instruction set grows, they will actively search for related technical videos. During this process, the in-depth technical content provided by PLCT will help students and engineers further understand the details and applications of RISC-V. Particularly, developing a RISC-V simulator will allow learners to intuitively grasp the fundamental principles of computer architecture and understand the process of hardware instruction execution. By guiding more students to participate in actual development, we can deepen their understanding of RISC-V and effectively boost the activity of the technical community, creating a virtuous cycle that will attract more young engineers to join the RISC-V ecosystem.Ultimately, this will foster a young, vibrant community of engineers who are passionate about RISC-V.By taking advantage of RISC-V's open-source nature and scalability, the deployment of large AI models will become a valuable opportunity for the development of the RISC-V ecosystem and community. It will also attract more students and engineers to contribute to its growth.","6 Feb 2025 07:34:44","6 Feb 2025 07:34:44","Double-blind review","","duoqilai","Fuyuan","","Zhang","zhangfuyuan@iscas.ac.cn","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","No","","Xirui","","Hao","2405677060@qq.com","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","No","luoyunxiang","Yunxiang","","Luo","luoyunxiang@iscas.ac.cn","The Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","duoqilai","","Fuyuan","","Zhang","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","","","","","","zhangfuyuan@iscas.ac.cn","","","","","CN","China","","Fuyuan Zhang (Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)); Xirui Hao (Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)); Yunxiang Luo (The Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS))","zhangfuyuan@iscas.ac.cn; 2405677060@qq.com; luoyunxiang@iscas.ac.cn","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Existing secure debugging methods authenticate debuggers but grant full access upon successful authentication, undermining the intended isolation.

inherent in their rapidly evolving ecosystem. A recent paper [1] implemented both known and novel side-channel
attacks targeting commercial RISC-V CPUs (U74 and C906). While this hardware-based research confirmed
vulnerabilities, it could not provide detailed insights into attack dynamics. We bridge this gap using the gem5
simulation framework to systematically analyze side-channel attacks on RISC-V architectures. Our paper focuses
on the access-retired attack, which exploits the unprivileged rdinstret instruction to infer protected filesystem
data. By tracking retired instruction counts, attackers detect microarchitectural state differences caused by
directory access checks. We utilize the gem5 simulator in full-system (FS) mode to capture kernel-level behaviors,
allowing us to analyze critical performance metrics including instruction retirement, cache performance, and
branch prediction statistics. This detailed simulation-based analysis is essential for understanding the behavior
of the attack and for developing effective countermeasures. Advancing RISC-V security research with simulation
tools like gem5 is thus a promising direction for mitigating future side-channel vulnerabilities.","6 Feb 2025 13:15:45","28 Feb 2025 20:57:04","Non-blind review","Demo","mahreen","Mahreen","","Khan","mahreen.khan@telecom-paris.fr","Telecom Paris","No","","Maria","","Mushtaq","maria.mushtaq@telecom-paris.fr","Telecom Paris","No","","Renaud","","Pacalet","renaud.pacalet@telecom-paris.fr","Telecom Paris","No","","Ludovic","","Apvrille","ludovic.apvrille@telecom-paris.fr","Telecom Paris","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","mahreen","","Mahreen","","Khan","Telecom Paris","","","","","","mahreen.khan@telecom-paris.fr","","Palaiseau","Ile-de-France","","FR","France","","Mahreen Khan (Telecom Paris); Maria Mushtaq (Telecom Paris); Renaud Pacalet (Telecom Paris); Ludovic Apvrille (Telecom Paris)","mahreen.khan@telecom-paris.fr; maria.mushtaq@telecom-paris.fr; renaud.pacalet@telecom-paris.fr; ludovic.apvrille@telecom-paris.fr","on","on","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zBZKDyDJE8BnACwVDbIUHeMwYY9tbIXY/view?usp=drive_link","on","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

The innovative Core-V eXtension InterFace (CV-X-IF) is a communication interface for RISC-V processors that significantly facilitates the integration of new instructions to the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), through tightly connected accelerators. In this paper, we present a TightlY-coupled accelerator for RISC-V for Code-based cryptogrAphy (TYRCA), proposing the first fully tightly-coupled hardware implementation of the HQC-PQC algorithm, leveraging the CV-X-IF. The proposed architecture is implemented on the Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA. Experimental results demonstrate that TYRCAr educes the execution time by 94% to 96% for HQC-128, HQC-192, and HQC-256, showcasing its potential for efficient HQC code-based cryptography.","6 Feb 2025 13:43:44","6 Feb 2025 13:44:48","Double-blind review","","aledolme","Alessandra","","Dolmeta","alessandra.dolmeta@polito.it","Politecnico di Torino","No","stefano.dimatteo","Stefano","","Di Matteo","stefano.dimatteo@cea.fr","CEA-Leti","No","emanuele.valea","Emanuele","","Valea","emanuele.valea@cea.fr","CEA LIST","No","","Mikael","","Carmona","mikael.carmona@cea.fr","CEA-Leti","No","","Antoine","","Loiseau","antoine.loiseau@cea.fr","CEA-Leti","No","maurizio.martina","Maurizio","","Martina","maurizio.martina@polito.it","Politecnico di Torino","No","guido.masera","Guido","","Masera","guido.masera@polito.it","Politecnico di Torino","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","stefano.dimatteo","","Stefano","","Di Matteo","CEA-Leti","","","","","","stefano.dimatteo@cea.fr","","Grenoble","France","","FR","France","","Alessandra Dolmeta (Politecnico di Torino); Stefano Di Matteo (CEA-Leti); Emanuele Valea (CEA LIST); Mikael Carmona (CEA-Leti); Antoine Loiseau (CEA-Leti); Maurizio Martina (Politecnico di Torino); Guido Masera (Politecnico di Torino)","alessandra.dolmeta@polito.it; stefano.dimatteo@cea.fr; emanuele.valea@cea.fr; mikael.carmona@cea.fr; antoine.loiseau@cea.fr; maurizio.martina@polito.it; guido.masera@polito.it","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

The globalization of the hardware supply chain, which is inherent in the RISC-V ecosystem, increases the risk of malicious insertions of Hardware Trojans (HTs) into the design. HTs are malicious modifications of hardware to change functionality or to leak secret data. Especially in safety- and security-critical areas like autonomous driving, HTs can cause severe consequences and endanger even human lives. We research how model checking based formal verification can be used in a systematic way to detect each HT inserted during hardware design reliably. We are the first to use signal connection properties on top of design functionality properties for more reliable HT detection. To reduce verification time and strongly increase HT detection coverage, we developed a tool to generate a high number of properties fully automatically. Additionally, we will publish a large set of specification and microarchitecture intent derived properties important for HT detection in processors and show how these properties have to be combined with connection properties for HT detection. Our work results in a guideline for reliable HT detection in processors using formal verification.","6 Feb 2025 14:48:28","7 Feb 2025 11:53:38","Double-blind review","","","Czea Sie","","Chuah","ge74yuw@mytum.de","Technical University of Munich","No","chrisapp","Christian","","Appold","c.appold@eu.denso.com","DENSO AUTOMOTIVE Deutschland GmbH","No","","Tim","","Leinmüller","t.leinmueller@eu.denso.com","DENSO AUTOMOTIVE Deutschland GmbH","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","chrisapp","","Christian","","Appold","DENSO AUTOMOTIVE Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","c.appold@eu.denso.com","","München","EMEAR","","DE","Germany","","Czea Sie Chuah (Technical University of Munich); Christian Appold (DENSO AUTOMOTIVE Deutschland GmbH); Tim Leinmüller (DENSO AUTOMOTIVE Deutschland GmbH)","ge74yuw@mytum.de; c.appold@eu.denso.com; t.leinmueller@eu.denso.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

The data pathway serializes UVM transactions into byte streams for transmission to SystemVerilog (SV), while SWIG enables parsing and reconstruction in high-level languages (e.g., Python). The control pathway exposes a step() method to drive UVM clocks programmatically. Experimental results on RISC-V cores demonstrate 45% fewer verification code lines, 50% faster debug cycles, and seamless bidirectional transaction flows between UVM and Python.

such as NumPy, pandas, and PyTorch, but with RISC-V these are largely unavailable. The problem is further
compounded by the challenge of building such packages manually, where even foundational examples such as
NumPy take a prohibitively long time to build from source on commonly-available hardware, in addition to being
prone to build errors and dependency chains that lead to long hours of sorting through confusing stack traces.

Trace-based simulation tools are advantageous for quickly modeling CPU and memory system performance. However, a proper instruction tracing tool for the RISC-V ISA is currently missing. We present Snooper, a fast and flexible RISC-V instruction tracer built as a QEMU TCG plugin. Snooper extracts information (e.g., source/destination registers) per executed instruction and generates customizable trace files, making it compatible with state-of-the-art trace-based CPU simulators. Supporting both user-mode and full-system execution, Snooper enables in-depth RISC-V analysis, including OS-level evaluation. We validate the traces generated by Snooper using ChampSim.

This isolation restricts the adoption of advanced methodologies, creating inefficiencies in collaborative RISC-V SoC validation. This paper proposes a novel methodology that encapsulates UVM environments and RTL designs as reusable software packages, By integrating Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM), UVM Connect (UVMC), and SWIG, we provide control and data pathways for cross-language verification. The data pathway serializes UVM transactions into byte streams for transmission to SystemVerilog (SV), while SWIG enables parsing and reconstruction in high-level languages (e.g., Python). The control pathway exposes a step() method to drive UVM clocks programmatically. Experimental results on RISC-V cores demonstrate 45% fewer verification code lines, 50% faster debug cycles, and seamless bidirectional transaction flows between UVM and Python. This approach bridges hardware verification and software-driven workflows, aligning with RISC-V's open-source ecosystem goals.","7 Feb 2025 02:07:58","8 Feb 2025 14:22:07","Double-blind review","","sfangyy","Fangyuan","","Song","sfangyy@outlook.com","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","makiras","Yunlong","","Xie","xieyunlong22@mails.ucas.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, CAS","No","liujincheng","Jincheng","","Liu","liujincheng24@mails.ucas.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","sfangyy","","Fangyuan","","Song","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","","","","","","sfangyy@outlook.com","","","","","CN","China","","Fangyuan Song (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences); Yunlong Xie (Institute of Computing Technology, CAS); Jincheng Liu (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences)","sfangyy@outlook.com; xieyunlong22@mails.ucas.ac.cn; liujincheng24@mails.ucas.ac.cn","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

ACE separates programming a key in the system for use by software from the actual use of the key, allowing separated environments to perform these functions. For instance, setting the key can be delegated to a secure TEE applet. ACE also provides instructions to perform cryptographic operations in an atomic fashion, in contrast to current round-based AES extensions, that by their nature cannot conceal the key.

This is achieved by configuring new architectural registers, called the Context Holding Registers (CHR), with the value of a key together with metadata that determines its usage and lifecycle management settings. The contents of these registers can
then only be exported in an encrypted and authenticated format which can be later reimported.

This allows software to securely use multiple keys, and the system stack to support context switching and even preservation
of keys during process or VM migration.

Weingarten and Tanvir Ahmed Khan","Double-blind review","Borja Perez; Olivier Sentieys","Accept as presentation","","Performance characterization is the key to unlocking efficient utilization of the underlying processing system. Rapid developments in specialized computing and hardware/software co-design make performance characterization more challenging—as the underlying hardware changes, so must the performance monitoring hardware and the accompanying performance models. CPU vendors have successfully popularized the top-down micro-architectural analysis (TMA) methodology that is effective in identifying true bottlenecks in a processor while abstracting away the hardware implementation. Unfortunately, researchers and practitioners are often limited to open-source RISC-V processors that lack hardware support for TMA or any other systematic performance characterization methodology. Even the simple scalar in-order RocketCore has not implemented performance hardware capable of providing enough information to support TMA, let alone more complex Out-of-Order (OoO) and super scalar SonicBOOM core. Furthermore, the challenges of performance characterization are compounded by the ever-increasing heterogeneity and specialization of hardware, and a wholistic performance characterization methodology for an entire System-on-Chip (SoC) remains open-ended.

"79","79X-H3G3B8P6J2","From RustVMM to Kata-Containers: Securing Container Workloads with H-ext Based Virtualization Software","Ruoqing He, Sheng Qu and Yanjun Wu","Non-blind review","Borja Perez; Olivier Sentieys","Accept as poster","","The work we are doing is critical for laying the foundation of a Confidential Computing software stack that will fully support the RISC-V architecture, equipped with H Extensions, AIA, and IOMMU capabilities. As the computing industry moves toward more secure infrastructures, RISC-V presents a unique opportunity with its open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) and its potential to be tailored for security-sensitive applications. Our Rust-based software stack, built around rust-vmm, is designed to capitalize on the RISC-V platform's extensibility, offering lightweight virtualization solutions such as Dragonball, StratoVirt, Cloud-Hypervisor, and Firecracker. These hypervisors, coupled with container runtimes like Kata Containers, provide the required isolation and performance needed in confidential computing environments, where the stakes for data privacy and security are higher than ever. By proactively developing this stack ahead of hardware availability, we ensure that once RISC-V chips with hardware extensions for virtualization and secure memory management hit the market, the ecosystem is ""plug-and-play"" ready.
Furthermore, by aiming to meet the RISC-V Server Platform Specification, our stack positions itself as an integral piece in the adoption and standardization of Confidential Computing across RISC-V-based server environments. We are creating an ecosystem that integrates secure VM isolation, efficient interrupt and I/O management, and flexible orchestration, all within a cloud-native framework. Our approach, reliant on Rust's inherent safety guarantees, provides a secure-by-design foundation that mitigates common vulnerabilities seen in traditional programming languages. This early work ensures that we are not just aligning with future hardware but actively shaping the software landscape required for secure, scalable, and robust RISC-V server platforms—empowering cloud providers, enterprises, and developers worldwide to leverage RISC-V's full potential.

Conventional approaches include: (1) compiling high-level C/C++ code using auto-vectorizing compilers (e.g., LLVM or GCC), (2) hand-optimizing performance-critical kernels using intrinsics or assembly, or (3) a hybrid of both—yielding the best binaries but requiring significant manual effort. Although auto-vectorization is fast, it often produces suboptimal code compared to what hand optimization can achieve. We propose an alternative: leverage existing hand-optimized kernels (originally developed for x86 AVX, ARM Neon, and other RISCV architectures) by generating compiler IR (e.g., LLVM IR) from these vector codes and then re-vectorizing it for the target processor using a tool like LLVM. This approach produces more optimal machine code than compiling high-level language code and yields structures that are easier to further hand-optimize. This also makes quick enablement of existing code bases in other ISA intrinsics on RISCV Vector Processors possible. In this paper, we detail our auto-re-vectorization method, its implementation, and present cycle-based performance comparisons against vector code generated from high-level language compilations and other existing approaches.","7 Feb 2025 05:22:02","7 Feb 2025 05:22:02","Double-blind review","","nisanthmp","Nisanth","","Mathilakath Padinharepatt","nisanthmp.01@gmail.com","MIPS","No","","Sanket","","Lonkar","slonkar@mips.com","MIPS","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","nisanthmp","","Nisanth","","Mathilakath Padinharepatt","MIPS","","","","","","nisanthmp.01@gmail.com","","Bangalore","Karnataka","","IN","India","","Nisanth Mathilakath Padinharepatt (MIPS); Sanket Lonkar (MIPS)","nisanthmp.01@gmail.com; slonkar@mips.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

The computational demands of large-scale matrix operations necessitate specialized hardware acceleration to improve efficiency and performance. To address this challenge, RISC-V International (RVI) formed the Integrated Matrix Extension (IME) Task Group. To serve immediate market demands, Andes Technology implements the Andes Matrix Multiplication (AMM) instruction set, an extension to the RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV), which Andes presented in IME meetings. The AMM instruction set introduces two primary enhancements:

1. Matrix operations optimized for 8-bit integers, specifically targeting AI and deep learning applications
2. Advanced 2D load/store instructions that minimize memory access overhead

To assess AMM's capabilities, we integrated it into the Intermediate Representation Execution Environment (IREE) for efficient compilation and execution on AMM-enabled RISC-V systems. A key aspect of this implementation involved extending IREE's compilation infrastructure, which included:

1. Developing a new MLIR pass to tensorize matrix multiplication and tensor data load/store operations
2. Designing a custom MLIR dialect tailored for AMM to support all its instructions.
3. Implementing conversion passes to lower matrix multiplication and tensor operations from the vector dialect to AMM one

Our evaluation covered a broad spectrum of AI models, ranging from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to large language models (LLMs), to measure performance improvements. This presentation explores the integration process, shares benchmark results, and discusses strategies for optimizing AI workloads using AMM and RISC-V Vector Extensions. We also examine the challenges encountered during AI model compilation and consider future developments in RISC-V-based AI acceleration.","7 Feb 2025 08:10:45","7 Feb 2025 08:10:45","Double-blind review","","","Pei-Hsiang","","Hung","nick@andestech.com","Andes Technology","No","","Chung-Hua","","Yen","howardse@andestech.com","Andes Technology","No","wuiw","I-WEI","","WU","wuiw@andestech.com","Andes Technology","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","wuiw","","I-WEI","","WU","Andes Technology","","","","","","wuiw@andestech.com","","Hsinchu","","","TW","Taiwan","","Pei-Hsiang Hung (Andes Technology); Chung-Hua Yen (Andes Technology); I-WEI WU (Andes Technology)","nick@andestech.com; howardse@andestech.com; wuiw@andestech.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

"89","89X-H3P7G7H3P4","An Architecture Design for Expressive Security","Jason Zhijingcheng Yu and Prateek Saxena","Double-blind review","Borja Perez; Olivier Sentieys","Accept as poster","","Today's computer systems face many security challenges such as memory safety violations, pressing need for fine-grained isolation, and growing demand for support of non-traditional trust models (e.g., confidential computing).
The prevalent approach to those challenges at the architecture level is security extensions designed to address
individual security requirements. This patchwork of special-purpose security extensions has two main problems.
Firstly, it is difficult for software to rely on them because of varying support in hardware implementations. The
hardware vendors can also modify or even deprecate security extensions at any time. Secondly, when software
desires multiple security goals, it has to compose multiple security extensions, which is often difficult or even
impossible. In light of this, we create Capstone, a new architecture design that provides a unified foundation
for achieving expressive security goals. Capstone adopts a capability-based model and extends it further to
support exclusive memory ownership, revocable access delegation, and extensible privilege hierarchies. We show
that Capstone enables various use cases such as two-way isolation as required by confidential computing that is
arbitrarily nestable, full memory safety, and detection of Rust principle violations, all through a single uniform

Jung, Alessio Burrello, Francesco Conti and Luca Benini","Non-blind review","Borja Perez; Olivier Sentieys","Accept as poster","","The success of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their high computational requirements pushed for large codesign efforts aiming at DNN acceleration. Since DNNs can be represented as static computational graphs, static memory allocation and tiling are two crucial optimizations. Hence, System-on-chips (SoCs) specialized for DNN acceleration commonly features a multi-level software-managed memory hierarchy. In such architecture, layer-wise tiling, i.e., splitting each layer into multiple sub-nodes, is commonly used; however, while reducing memory occupation, it can increase the total memory transfer, ultimately causing costly off-chip memory copies, which impact energy efficiency and create memory bottlenecks. This work proposes Fused-Tiled Layers (FTL), a novel algorithm for automatic fusion between tiled layers. We leverage the flexibility and efficiency of a RISC-V (RV32) heterogeneous SoC to integrate FTL in an open-source deployment framework, which we tune for RISC-V targets. We demonstrate that FTL brings up to 60.1% runtime reduction for a typical Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) stage of Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to the reduction of off-chip transfer and on-chip data movement by 47.1 %.","7 Feb 2025 09:51:47","7 Feb 2025 09:51:47","Non-blind review","","victorjbjung","Victor","","Jung","Jungvi@iis.ee.ethz.ch","ETH Zurich","No","aleburrello","Alessio","","Burrello","alessio.burrello@polito.it","Politecnico di Torino and UniversitÃ  di Bologna","No","fconti","Francesco","","Conti","f.conti@unibo.it","University of Bologna","No","lucabeniniunibo","Luca","","Benini","luca.benini@unibo.it","Università di Bologna and ETH Zurich","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","victorjbjung","","Victor","J.

Traditional methods for hardware verification, software debugger bring-up, and hardware-software debugger compatibility are performed on emulation platforms such as Zebu from Synopsys or Palladium from Cadence using JTAG debuggers. Emulation, while effective for bug discovery with high turnaround time, offers limited debug visibility compared to simulation. Dependency on physical JTAG debugger caps the number of users to hardware availability. This paper describes mechanism to use the same software debugger on the simulation environment too and remove the use of physical JTAG debugger. The hardware to software communication utilizes a synthesizable JTAG transactor integrated into the Emulation environment, which interfaces seamlessly with the software debugger via TCP/IP sockets (or any other interprocess communication protocol). This enables issue of software debugger commands to hardware, as part of use-case stimuli. The collaterals for communication and stimuli are used in the simulation environment too, facilitating the rerun of emulation failures in simulation platform for bug resolution.","7 Feb 2025 10:39:26","7 Feb 2025 10:39:26","Double-blind review","","rejeeshsb","Rejeesh","","Shaji Babu","rejeesh.sb@ashling.com","Ashling Microsystems","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","rejeeshsb","","Rejeesh","","Shaji Babu","Ashling Microsystems","","","","","","rejeesh.sb@ashling.com","","Limerick","Limeric","","IE","Ireland","","Rejeesh Shaji Babu (Ashling Microsystems)","rejeesh.sb@ashling.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

to execute all fundamental arithmetic operations of HDC directly through dedicated instructions, which, when
appropriately combined, enable a variety of learning tasks by efficiently encoding and processing information.
This extension is coupled with a specialized hardware acceleration unit, integrated into the Klessydra-T03 RISC-V
core, to perform computations on binary HVs efficiently. The proposed solution enables a seamless trade-off
between execution time and hardware resource utilization through both synthesis-time configurability and runtime
programmability. The custom ISA extension is fully integrated into the RISC-V GCC toolchain, allowing

sequential events across various domains. One of the most powerful tools in this field is Matrix Profile, which
allows for scalable and accurate detection of anomalies and repetitive patterns. Specifically, SCAMP has emerged
as one of the most efficient methods for computing the Matrix Profile due to its robustness, efficiency, and high
parallelization capability. Vectorization is a powerful optimization technique for these algorithms, as it exploits
SIMD instructions in modern CPUs to enhance computational efficiency. In this context, the RISC-V Vector
Extension (RVV) introduces a flexible vector model with dynamic lengths. This enables algorithm optimization
across different hardware platforms without requiring source code modifications. In this paper, we vectorize
the SCAMP algorithm using the RISC-V Vector Extension and analyze the achieved speedup compared to
the non-vectorized baseline. Additionally, we explore the benefits of dynamic vectors and compare them with
alternative implementations. The results show speedup improvements of up to 94× over the sequential version

Efficient design of RISC-V systems requires a fast and accurate performance evaluation methodology. However, current approaches for LLM inference on RISC-V platforms primarily focus on basic operators like GEMM rather than full workloads. It neglects some software-hardware co-optimization effects such as speculative decoding, resulting in inaccurate performance evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose a framework for running and analyzing LLM workloads on RISC-V platforms. We further observe that executing full workloads incurs prohibitive time costs. To overcome the problem, we propose a novel sampling workflow which extracts representative program segments that dominate the performance. This tool enables efficient and precise evaluation, facilitating optimization on both RISC-V software and hardware.","7 Feb 2025 13:27:00","7 Feb 2025 13:27:00","Double-blind review","","cailuoshan","Luoshan","","Cai","cailuoshan22z@ict.ac.cn","Beijing Institute of Open Source Chip","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cailuoshan","","Luoshan","","Cai","Beijing Institute of Open Source Chip","","","","","","cailuoshan22z@ict.ac.cn","","","","","CN","China","","Luoshan Cai (Beijing Institute of Open Source Chip)","cailuoshan22z@ict.ac.cn","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

For RISC-V, verification becomes even more critical to support a wide range of applications and extensions. Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) has been widely adopted to provide better visibility and detect unexpected behaviors. While ABV enhances efficiency but is limited to slow software simulations. FPGA prototyping offers faster alternatives but lacks fine-grained debugging for error analysis. To address these challenges, we present Hassert, an efficient ABV framework that combines high-performance verification on FPGAs with fine-grained debugging in software. Hassert automates the scheduling and mapping of SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) to the FPGA, allowing for extensive hardware testing. To further improve debugging efficiency, Hassert enables dynamic switching of assertions and uArch-guided snapshots based on the assertion. We demonstrate that these contributions significantly enhance verification efficiency over software simulations for various designs, with minimal area overhead and full debugging visibility.","7 Feb 2025 13:38:58","7 Feb 2025 13:38:58","Double-blind review","","zakilim","Ziqing","","Zhang","zhangziqing23z@ict.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, CAS","No","","Weijie","","Weng","wengweijie@ict.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, CAS","No","baoyungang","Yungang","","Bao","baoyg@ict.ac.cn","ICT, CAS","No","karlshi","Kan","","Shi","shikan@ict.ac.cn","Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","zakilim","","Ziqing","","Zhang","Institute of Computing Technology, CAS","","","","","","zhangziqing23z@ict.ac.cn","","Beijing","Beijing","","CN","China","","Ziqing Zhang (Institute of Computing Technology, CAS); Weijie Weng (Institute of Computing Technology, CAS); Yungang Bao (ICT, CAS); Kan Shi (Chinese Academy of Sciences)","zhangziqing23z@ict.ac.cn; wengweijie@ict.ac.cn; baoyg@ict.ac.cn; shikan@ict.ac.cn","","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

This paper introduces Project AGNI, a Dual-Mode AI Accelerator designed to dynamically adapt to workload variations through its integration with Tejas, A Transformative Energy Efficient Joint Scalable CPU Architecture.

The architecture is particularly suited for edge AI applications including drone-based machine learning, IoT devices, autonomous robotics, and mobile AI workloads, where traditional GPUs are impractical due to power and area constraints. The proposed dual-mode execution model enables High-Performance Mode for computationally intensive workloads such as CNNs and real-time AI inference, while the Low-Workload Mode optimizes efficiency for lighter tasks, including Pooling, Fully Connected (FC) layers and small-scale AI computations.

We describe two case studies to highlight the power of this implementation and provide quantitative data to show the efficiency of this implementation.","7 Feb 2025 15:36:05","10 Mar 2025 11:15:34","Double-blind review","Poster","marcel.zak","Marcel","","Zak","marcel.zak@siemens.com","Siemens EDA","No","","Mat","","O'Donnell","mat.odonnell@siemens.com","Siemens EDA","No","","Vivek","","Chickermane","vivek.chickermane@siemens.com","Siemens EDA","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","marcel.zak","","Marcel","","Zak","Siemens EDA","","","","","","marcel.zak@siemens.com","","Cambridge","Cambridgeshire","","GB","United Kingdom","","Marcel Zak (Siemens EDA); Mat O'Donnell (Siemens EDA); Vivek Chickermane (Siemens EDA)","marcel.zak@siemens.com; mat.odonnell@siemens.com; vivek.chickermane@siemens.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

The authentication of data is facilitated by authenticated encryption in DRAM and by the presence of integrity tags that are dependent on a unique key. These mechanisms have been designed to mitigate attacks such as RowHammer, fault injection and side-channel attacks throughout the memory hierarchy.

However, the high cost of proprietary EDA tools remains a significant challenge, limiting access for both industry and academia. To fully unlock the potential of open-source hardware, the RISC-V ecosystem requires open-source EDA solutions that are scalable and efficient.
najaeda is a robust framework designed for post-synthesis EDA algorithm development, offering high-capacity hierarchical netlist processing and seamless integration into the open-source EDA ecosystem. This presentation explores najaeda's data structures, Python-based APIs, and practical applications, demonstrating how it enhances netlist exploration, Engineering Change Order (ECO) transformations, and EDA prototyping.
We will showcase an example of najaeda's netlist optimization techniques, specifically Constant Propagation and Dead Logic Elimination, applied to medium-to-large RISC-V designs. Unlike traditional flat synthesis approaches, which dominate open-source workflows, najaeda preserves design hierarchy, ensuring better algorithmic performance, improved user guidance in downstream tools, and enhanced data fidelity. Additionally, by maintaining structural integrity, najaeda enables integration with Python-based data science frameworks like Pandas and PyTorch, paving the way for AI-driven EDA optimizations.
This work highlights najaeda as a key enabler of scalable, industrial-grade open-source EDA, helping the RISC-V community develop high-performance designs without reliance on proprietary tools.","7 Feb 2025 15:53:41","7 Feb 2025 15:53:41","Double-blind review","","xtof","Christophe","","Alexandre","christophe.alexandre@keplertech.io","keplertech.io","No","","Noam","","Cohen","noam.cohen@keplertech.io","keplertech.io","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","xtof","","Christophe","","Alexandre","keplertech.io","","","","","","christophe.alexandre@keplertech.io","","PALAISEAU","","","FR","France","","Christophe Alexandre (keplertech.io); Noam Cohen (keplertech.io)","christophe.alexandre@keplertech.io; noam.cohen@keplertech.io","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

The framework tackles the challenge of lengthy verification cycles required to achieve hard-to-reach coverage points, particularly in complex processors. 

Our solution enhances verification efficiency through two key components. 

First, we implement a hardware fuzzer that rapidly generates large-scale RISC-V instruction sequences. Instead of simply using random instructions, the fuzzing-based instructions are specifically designed to achieve better coverage while exploring hard-to-reach states during RISC-V processor verification. 

Second, we develop an end-to-end verification framework that iteratively
generates coverage-directed stimuli using the hardware fuzzer, applies them to the design-under-test (DUT), collects coverage data, and identifies uncovered states for further fuzzing iterations. Through FPGA acceleration, our framework achieves 2.03× speedup against conventional software approaches.","7 Feb 2025 15:57:13","7 Feb 2025 16:14:55","Double-blind review","","","Yang","","Zhong","zhongyang23s@ict.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","No","","Haoran","","Wu","hw691@cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge, United Kingdom","No","","Yungang","","Bao","baoyg@ict.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","No","","Kan","","Shi","shikan@ict.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences, China","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","shikyeeee","","yang","","zhong","Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences","","","","","","shikyeeee@gmail.com","","","","","CN","China","","Yang Zhong (Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences, China); Haoran Wu (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom); Yungang Bao (Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences, China); Kan Shi (Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences, China)","zhongyang23s@ict.ac.cn; hw691@cam.ac.uk; baoyg@ict.ac.cn; shikan@ict.ac.cn","","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

This abstraction, however, tends to limit the ability to detect behavioral deviations, especially for attack classes that exploit vulnerabilities very close to the target hardware. Conversely, too low a level of abstraction tends to significantly increase the complexity of the system model, and therefore poses a number of difficulties for the extraction and selection of relevant observables for a given class of attack.

Hardware performance counters in particular have been used as an indirect means of observing micro-architecture behavior and detecting software attempting to exploit hardware vulnerabilities.
In order to improve the various detection methods, we propose the construction of hardware metrics designed from the outset for security, by studying the correlation between signals from the micro-architecture and the various classes of attack in the literature, targeting both conventional IT and industrial OT systems.
By extension, this work aims to detect attacks originating from hardware Trojans, the latter having the effect of changing the behavior of a given micro-architecture.","7 Feb 2025 16:14:15","7 Feb 2025 16:14:15","Double-blind review","","lgeorget","Lucas","","Georget","lucas.georget@laas.fr","EDF R&D / LAAS-CNRS","No","","Vincent","","Migliore","vincent.migliore@laas.fr","LAAS-CNRS","No","","Vincent","","Nicomette","vincent.nicomette@laas.fr","LAAS-CNRS","No","","Frédéric","","Silvi","frederic.silvi@edf.fr","EDF R&D","No","","Arthur","","Villard","arthur.villard@edf.fr","EDF R&D","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","lgeorget","","Lucas","","Georget","EDF R&D / LAAS-CNRS","","","","","","lucas.georget@laas.fr","","","","","FR","France","","Lucas Georget (EDF R&D / LAAS-CNRS); Vincent Migliore (LAAS-CNRS); Vincent Nicomette (LAAS-CNRS); Frédéric Silvi (EDF R&D); Arthur Villard (EDF R&D)","lucas.georget@laas.fr; vincent.migliore@laas.fr; vincent.nicomette@laas.fr; frederic.silvi@edf.fr; arthur.villard@edf.fr","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Silicon democratization can greatly benefit from end-to-end (from silicon technology to software) free and open-source (OS) platforms. We present Croc, an extensible RISC-V microcontroller platform explicitly targeted at hands-on teaching and innovation. Croc features a streamlined OS synthesis and an end-to-end OS implementation flow, ensuring full, unconstrained access to the design, the design automation tools, and the implementation technology. Croc uses the industry-proven, open-source CVE2 core, implementing the RV32I(EMC) instruction set architecture (ISA), enabling students to define and implement their own ISA extensions. MLEM, a tapeout of Croc in IHP's open 130 nm node completed in 8 weeks by a team of just two students, demonstrates the platform's viability for hands-on teaching in schools, universities, or even on a self-education path. In spring 2025, ETH Zurich will utilize Croc for its curricular VLSI class, involving up to 80 students, producing up to 40 OS application-specific integrated circuit layouts, and completing up to five student-led system-on-chip tapeouts.

This issue is being addressed by the CHERI (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions) technology developed by University of Cambridge and which, with the formation of the  CHERI TG/SIG, RISC-V developers now have a fantastic opportunity to take to market.

When the RISC-V CHERI Extension is enabled in a hart all memory accesses are made via capabilities rather than pointers. These capabilities incorporate bounds and permission which are checked on every single memory access, thus providing fine grained memory protection

To ensure that capabilities cannot be forged or manipulated by an adversary, CHERI requires that the system implements an out-of-band tag bit for every element of memory storage that can hold a capability. This tag and the data it protects must appear by all observers in the system to be updated atomically.

The presentation will describe the challenges associated with efficient handling of tags at a system level and how Codasip has met them in the development of the first commercially available System IP to solve this issue: the Capability Management Unit (CMU) which we will be demonstrating at the Summit.","7 Feb 2025 17:05:37","7 Feb 2025 17:05:37","Non-blind review","","markbhill","Mark","","Hill","mark.hill@codasip.com","Codasip","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","markbhill","","Mark","Bowen","Hill","Codasip","","","+447980520101","","","mark.hill@codasip.com","","Bristol","","","GB","United Kingdom","","Mark Bowen Hill (Codasip)","mark.hill@codasip.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Addressing the concurrent demands of heterogeneous tasks, including AI inference, real-time graphics rendering, and high-performance signal processing, this presentation focuses on atomic IO enqueue instructions - the core technology enabling hardware accelerator interactions in heterogeneous computing architectures. This approach establishes efficient accelerator communication mechanisms through hardware primitives such as 64-byte atomic enqueue transfers and queue status feedback. At the protocol level, PCIe specifications define DMWr TLP (Transaction Layer Packet) for non-post write operations, while Armv8.7/9.2 implements 64-byte atomic enqueue operations via ST64BV instructions, and x86 architectures provide comparable functionality through MOVDIR64B and ENQCMD(S) instructions.

The applications in these domains often involve complex simulations, large-scale data analysis, and advanced modeling, which require potent hardware and software to process data efficiently. Modern real-time embedded systems utilize various timing-aware scheduling strategies for the efficient execution of such high-performance applications. However, in the absence of a specified worst-case execution time (WCET), it is difficult to provide a predictable execution time for applications running on these systems. WCET is essential for real-time systems where timely responses to events are critical for correct system operation, especially in safety-critical applications like medical devices or automotive control systems. In this article, we propose a RISC-V-based vector co-processor that has consistent, repeatable timing behavior with no timing anomalies, which allows for precise and efficient WCET analysis while maintaining the efficiency and performance often found in other vector processors.","7 Feb 2025 17:23:51","7 Feb 2025 17:23:51","Double-blind review","","sonam","SONAM","","SINGH","sonami@iiitd.ac.in","Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi","No","","Seetharaman","","Raja","seetharaman.raja@thalesgroup.com","Thales India Private Limited, Bangalore","No","","Subhra","","Das","subhra-kanti.das@thalesgroup.com","Thales India Private Limited, Bangalore","No","sdeb","Sujay","","Deb","sdeb@iiitd.ac.in","IIIT Delhi","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","sonam","","SONAM","","SINGH","Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi","","","","","","sonami@iiitd.ac.in","","NEW DELHI","DELHI","","IN","India","","SONAM SINGH (Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi); Seetharaman Raja (Thales India Private Limited, Bangalore); Subhra Kanti Das (Thales India Private Limited, Bangalore); Sujay Deb (IIIT Delhi)","sonami@iiitd.ac.in; seetharaman.raja@thalesgroup.com; subhra-kanti.das@thalesgroup.com; sdeb@iiitd.ac.in","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

The Module Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (ML-KEM) and the Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) are the two main NIST standards.
This work addresses the acceleration of ML-KEM and ML-DSA on the Sargantana RV64GBV core using the standard bit manipulation (B) and vector (V) extensions.
We compare the performance of the reference implementations with a recently proposed version in which the most computationally intensive operations of module lattice cryptography are optimized through carefully crafted assembly routines.
In addition, we compare the hand-optimized vectorized speedup with the performance of code produced by a recent RISC-V compiler through auto-vectorization and insertion of bit manipulation operations.
Our results demonstrate that standard BV extensions significantly improve performance, providing speedups ranging from 3.18× to 4.59× for ML-KEM and ML-DSA. 
With hand-tuned assembly routines, RV64 cores lacking BV extensions can achieve up to 3.29× speedup over the reference implementation. 
Lastly, compiler-emitted code lags behind hand-optimized kernels, with auto-bit manipulation showing better results than auto-vectorization in accelerating these schemes.","7 Feb 2025 17:26:42","7 Feb 2025 17:26:42","Double-blind review","","xcarril","Xavier","","Carril Gil","xavier.carril@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","","Emanuele","","Parisi","emanuele.parisi@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","","Narcís","","Rodas Quiroga","narcis.rodaquiroga@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","","Raúl","","Gilabert Gámez","raul.gilabert@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","","Juan Antonio","","Rodríguez Gracia","juan.rodriguez4@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","","Oriol","","Farràs Ventura","oriol.farras@urv.cat","Universitat Rovira i Virgili","No","mmoreto","Miquel","","Moreto","mmoreto@ac.upc.edu","BSC","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","xcarril","","Xavier","","Carril Gil","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","","","","","","xavier.carril@bsc.es","","Barcelona","Barcelona","","ES","Spain","","Xavier Carril Gil (Barcelona Supercomputing Center); Emanuele Parisi (Barcelona Supercomputing Center); Narcís Rodas Quiroga (Barcelona Supercomputing Center); Raúl Gilabert Gámez (Barcelona Supercomputing Center); Juan Antonio Rodríguez Gracia (Barcelona Supercomputing Center); Oriol Farràs Ventura (Universitat Rovira i Virgili); Miquel Moreto (BSC)","xavier.carril@bsc.es; emanuele.parisi@bsc.es; narcis.rodaquiroga@bsc.es; raul.gilabert@bsc.es; juan.rodriguez4@bsc.es; oriol.farras@urv.cat; mmoreto@ac.upc.edu","","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

The proposed system is aimed towards robust (uncertainty-aware) yet low-power Bayesian edge intelligence. Using Bayesian inference, not only the prediction itself, but the prediction confidence can also be extracted for planning risk-aware actions. However, Bayesian inference of a deep neural network (DNN) is computationally expensive, ill-suited for real-time and/or edge deployment. An approximation to Bayesian DNN using Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout) has shown high robustness along with low computational complexity. The novel CIM module can perform in-memory probabilistic dropout in addition to in-memory weight-input scalar product.

Various vectorization techniques, including loop unrolling to reduce overhead, data parallelism for simultaneous processing of multiple data elements, and instruction-level parallelism to execute multiple instructions per clock cycle, along with SIMD and SIMT, can be employed to enhance performance. By leveraging these vectorization techniques, XGBoost - CatBoost libraries are optimized to achieve significant performance gains on the EUPilot VEC chiplet, a cutting-edge, low-power, and highly scalable vector processing unit designed to accelerate machine learning workloads, which is a key component of the EUPilot Horizon Europe project, aiming to develop a scalable and energy-efficient computing platform. The optimized libraries are evaluated on a molecular binding dataset, where the goal is to predict the binding affinity of small molecules to target proteins. The optimized libraries demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency, enabling faster and more accurate predictions. Specifically, manual vectorization using intrinsics, as well as automated vectorization tools and techniques, are employed to optimize the computationally intensive loops in Gradient Boosting Algorithms. The optimized libraries for the EUPilot chiplet are compared to non-optimized versions, and the results are analyzed in terms of performance gain, accuracy, and computational efficiency.","7 Feb 2025 19:23:42","7 Feb 2025 19:23:42","Double-blind review","","","Ali","","Atalay","ali.atalay@ai4sec.eu","AI4SEC OÜ","No","","Orkun","","Hasekioğlu","orkun.hasekioglu@tubitak.gov.tr","TUBITAK Fundamental Sciences Research Institute","No","enissen","Muhammed","","Sen","m.enis.97@gmail.com","AI4SEC OÜ","No","","Şener","","Özönder","sener.ozonder@bogazici.edu.tr","Boğaziçi University","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","enissen","","Muhammed","Enis","Sen","AI4SEC OÜ","","","","","","m.enis.97@gmail.com","","","","","TR","Turkey","","Ali Serdar Atalay (AI4SEC OÜ); Orkun Hasekioğlu (TUBITAK Fundamental Sciences Research Institute); Muhammed Enis Sen (AI4SEC OÜ); Şener Özönder (Boğaziçi University)","ali.atalay@ai4sec.eu; orkun.hasekioglu@tubitak.gov.tr; m.enis.97@gmail.com; sener.ozonder@bogazici.edu.tr","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

By moving the memory allocation management complexity from software to hardware, many of the processor cycles needed to execute typical allocation functions of software objects in memory can be avoided, delivering significant performance advantages and energy savings.  

This session will detail the concepts and techniques fundamental to the adoption of a new object memory model, enabling full memory safety at gate level within the processor, as well as enhancing cache utilisation, minimising event processing latency, and reducing overall memory heap requirements. It will show how these significant optimisations can be brought to modern power efficiency sensitive, compute-intensive, applications, include large-scale web enterprises, high volume data analytics, bioinformatics, and the complex data processing needs of compute intensive applications.","7 Feb 2025 20:26:47","7 Feb 2025 20:26:47","Double-blind review","","","Ed","","Nutting","ed.nutting@vypercore.com","CTO Vypercore","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","andyatvypercore","","Andy","","Frame","VyperCore","","","","","","andy.frame@vypercore.com","","Cambridge","Cambridgeshire","","GB","United Kingdom","","Ed Nutting (CTO Vypercore)","ed.nutting@vypercore.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

However, in medical AI commercialization, meeting these demands is only part of the challenge. A critical hurdle is ensuring compliance with stringent regulatory standards such as FDA (U.S.), CE (Europe), and MDR (Medical Device Regulation), while maintaining innovation, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Traditional, some proprietary architecture often present significant barriers to achieving this balance. In contrast, RISC-V, with its open-source, modular ISA design, offers a key to unlocking this potential and fosters open collaboration, accelerating AI-specific optimizations across diverse applications. Its flexibility allows for tailored AI acceleration and secure computing – leading to, for example, significantly faster image processing times in diagnostic imaging or lower latency in real-time. This and verifiable regulatory compliance across hardware, operating systems, and software stacks of the RISC-V ecosystem, lower entry barriers and increase profitability by reducing development costs and speeding up time-to-market. This paper explores how RISC-V's open ecosystem supports regulatory adherence, drives AI-optimized medical solutions, and unlocks new opportunities for scalable, secure, and cost-effective AI-driven healthcare innovations.","7 Feb 2025 20:33:10","7 Feb 2025 20:33:10","Double-blind review","","rajaghv.dev","Raja Gopal Hari Vijay","","Sitharaman","rajaghv.dev@gmail.com","Zoho Corporation","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","rajaghv.dev","","Raja Gopal Hari Vijay","","Sitharaman","Zoho Corporation","","","","","","rajaghv.dev@gmail.com","","Chennai","Tamil Nadu","","IN","India","","Raja Gopal Hari Vijay Sitharaman (Zoho Corporation)","rajaghv.dev@gmail.com","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Currently, the RISC-V specification (including both ratified and de-facto parts) is scattered across multiple repositories and cloud storage files. Little of it is machine-readable, and in many cases information is duplicated in error-prone ways. This presents a barrier to further RISC-V growth as it is increasingly difficult to understand (and especially verify) the complex and growing specification. By gathering the specification in a single database, UDB provides the means to quickly find information and to generate artifacts directly from an authority. Towards that end, UDB currently includes over ten generators, including ones that produce ISA manuals, instruction and CSR indices, and an Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) -- all from the same source. Though tremendous progress has been made in the last year, UDB is still a work in progress, and we are actively looking for increased community participation.","7 Feb 2025 21:16:58","7 Feb 2025 21:16:58","Non-blind review","","dhower","Derek","","Hower","dhower@qti.qualcomm.com","Qualcomm","No","","Afonso","","Oliveira","Afonso.Oliveira@synopsys.com","Synopsys","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","dhower","","Derek","R","Hower","Qualcomm","","","","","","dhower@qti.qualcomm.com","","Raleigh","NC","","US","United States","","Derek R.

In this work, we advocate that the RISC-V ISA (and related specifications) cannot efficiently support critical sections for real-time automotive systems. To address that, we propose a novel AIA extension. We implemented the proposed extension on a CVA6-based SoC endowed with an Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) IP and functionally validated the intended behavior. We are now collecting empirical evidence to support the discussion of the current proposal at RISC-V International.

Traditional approaches to fine-grained memory protection have often resulted in significant performance penalties and/or incomplete security coverage. Unlike traditional approaches, CHERI claims to provide robust, deterministic security with minimal performance loss. As CHERI takes a hardware/software co-design approach, hardware, software and compilers need to be optimized to realize good performance.

Trace based models are higher levels of abstraction than true design data but incorporate descriptions of micro architectural features such as pipeline, bus or memory system behavior. They typically cannot execute code directly but take an execution trace from a model such as an ISS (which is architecturally accurate but does not have timing information). Together they can be used to estimate application performance before the design is complete. These complimentary technologies are extremely important in their own right, however, when used together create a powerful system that facilitates hardware-software co-design bringing software engineers and micro-architects together using the same technology that each discipline is already familiar with. Both the ISS and trace-based models are commonly developed ahead of RTL. In the context of IP licensing, customers can provide an execution trace to the IP company; the IP company does not need to share or productize the trace-based model, while the customer doesn't need to share the software or source code for workloads. RISC-V international has a working group developing the STF trace format designed for exactly this use case.

To counter these attacks, cache designs incorporating cache randomization have emerged as a highly effective solution. However, these techniques rely on address remapping for all instructions, thus introducing performance drawbacks and risks of breaking remapping within the rekeying interval. We propose a novel cache architecture and control mechanism called SCAR that performs selective remapping of instructions, thus enhancing security while minimizing performance overhead.

However, current research on agile verification primarily focuses on system-level verification. As chip development progresses, the cost of fixing bugs may increase exponentially. To enable a shift-left verification effort, we propose AccUnit: an end-to-end tool flow for efficient unit-level verification of RISC-V processors using heterogeneous hardware acceleration. AccUnit automatically duplicates the design-under-test (DUT) to fit the FPGA alongside software reference models running on the host, while generating distinct input stimulus sets for each DUT and reference model pair. The proposed system monitors and compares key I/O ports between the DUT and reference model, enabling massive parallel execution of automated unit-level self-checking for RISC-V processor modules. We also integrate a coverage collection scheme where synthesizable coverpoints are automatically created and inserted into the DUT during compile time. This allows coverage information to be collected on the FPGA during operation, enabling comprehensive evaluation of functional verification quality.

As the software testing ecosystem has benefited from various tools and methods developed by its large community, this success offers a promising future for scaling out hardware verification by incorporating software testing developers.  
To support software developers in hardware verification, we propose three techniques to facilitate this integration: (1) providing state machine abstractions (cycle-accurate and loosely-timed), (2) encapsulating hardware designs into software packages in multiple programming languages, and (3) introducing socket data transport and bidirectional direct function calls. 
These techniques are implemented on the UnityChip Verification(UCV) platform,  enabling software developers and tools to engage in hardware verification workflows and collaborate with hardware engineers using hardware frameworks.  
We evaluate our methods on the XiangShan processor, demonstrating UCV's effectiveness through case studies: software developers without hardware backgrounds uncover 11 bugs in two months. Zero-experience developers submit valid verification cases in 20 hours, and reducing average initiation time by 77% and enhancing existing verification environment with Python, accelerating the process by 16.6% and reducing lines of code by 12%.","8 Feb 2025 06:43:20","8 Feb 2025 06:43:20","Double-blind review","","makiras","Yunlong","","Xie","xieyunlong22@mails.ucas.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, CAS","No","","Zhicheng","","Yao","yaozhicheng@bosc.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, CAS","No","","Sa","","Wang","wangsa@ict.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, CAS","No","baoyungang","Yungang","","Bao","baoyg@ict.ac.cn","ICT, CAS","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","makiras","","Yunlong","","Xie","Institute of Computing Technology, CAS","","","","","","xieyunlong22@mails.ucas.ac.cn","","Haidian","xieyunlong22@mails.ucas.ac.cn","","CN","China","","Yunlong Xie (Institute of Computing Technology, CAS); Zhicheng Yao (Institute of Computing Technology, CAS); Sa Wang (Institute of Computing Technology, CAS); Yungang Bao (ICT, CAS)","xieyunlong22@mails.ucas.ac.cn; yaozhicheng@bosc.ac.cn; wangsa@ict.ac.cn; baoyg@ict.ac.cn","","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Even before it reached the global market, developers were able to use Renode, Antmicro's open-source simulation framework, to develop, debug and test software targeting PolarFire SoC. With a capable FPGA on board, PolarFire SoC opens a range of possibilities for system designers and engineers, but it also calls for versatile tools that would support development and making architectural choices.

RISC-V currently uses a much slower traditional approach where TLB shootdown is done by broadcasting an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) to all affected harts. The sender of an IPI must stall until it collects acknowledgments from all target harts; each target hart is normally running some other software but it must take an exception to run a trap handler that evicts the specified TLB entry or entries and sends back an acknowledgment. In this early-stage research, we are reviewing the state-of-the-art in hardware and software techniques to accelerate TLB shootdown, and instrumenting the Linux kernel to help develop a new RISC-V mechanism that can accelerate remote TLB invalidations. The most promising techniques in research utilize a familiar hardware feature: cache coherence.","8 Feb 2025 08:09:27","8 Feb 2025 08:09:27","Double-blind review","","","John","","Deppe","johndeppe@gmail.com","The University of British Columbia","No","","Steven","","Yeung","yeung@andestech.com","Andes Technology","No","lemieux","Guy","","Lemieux","lemieux@ece.ubc.ca","The University of British Columbia","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","lemieux","","Guy","","Lemieux","The University of British Columbia","","","","","","lemieux@ece.ubc.ca","","","","","CA","Canada","","John Deppe (The University of British Columbia); Steven Yeung (Andes Technology); Guy Lemieux (The University of British Columbia)","johndeppe@gmail.com; yeung@andestech.com; lemieux@ece.ubc.ca","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

However, developing ODL-capable, battery-operated embedded platforms presents significant challenges due to constrained computational resources and limited device lifetime, besides intrinsic learning issues such as catastrophic forgetting. We face these challenges by proposing a regularization-based On-Device Federated Continual Learning algorithm tailored for multiple nano-drones performing face recognition tasks. We demonstrate our approach on a RISC-V-based 10-core ultra-low-power SoC, optimizing the ODL computational requirements.

"213","213X-E6F7G6A6C3","Development of Fedora Linux Distribution for RISC-V (RV64G) Architecture","Billa Surendra","Double-blind review","Borja Perez; Olivier Sentieys","Accept as poster","","The continuous advancement of the RISC-V architecture introduces both opportunities and challenges, particularly
for systems that do not include compressed instruction support (RV64G). Current Fedora Linux distributions
predominantly target the RV64GC variant, leaving a significant gap in support for RV64G-based systems, which
are essential for various research and development applications. The RISC-V community actively contributes to
system software development, particularly in the Linux ecosystem. While much of the existing work is focused
on enabling Fedora for the RV64GC profile, our research extends this effort by developing Fedora for sub-set
profiles like RV64G.
Many startups, academic researchers, and independent developers encounter difficulties in adopting mandated
RISC-V profiles such as RV22 due to the complexity and cost associated with designing processors that incorporate
multiple extensions. As hardware constraints and development costs rise, access to a functional Linux distribution
across all RISC-V variants becomes increasingly critical. Our work addresses this need by delivering a Fedora
version optimized for RV64G, facilitating broader adoption among those unable to develop or afford processors
with mandatory extension support.
Key aspects of this work involve building a scalable and reliable filesystem hierarchy, creating a cross-compilation
toolchain, preparing and bootstrapping the target image, integrating a native GCC compiler, and utilizing the
Koji build system to streamline package rebuilding. Additionally, we introduce a custom Python-based tool to
enhance automation and reproducibility by efficiently managing Koji builds, ensuring uniformity in package
deployment.
Beyond addressing immediate software enablement challenges, this work establishes a solid foundation for
advancing High-Performance Computing (HPC) on the RISC-V platform. By enabling a fully operational Fedora
Server edition for RISC-V, our contributions support the widespread adoption of RISC-V in both research and
enterprise domains. Furthermore, our development methodology follows the upstream-first policy, ensuring
long-term maintainability and seamless integration into the Fedora ecosystem. This research not only expands
Linux distribution support for various RISC-V profiles but also strengthens the RISC-V community by making
Fedora more accessible across diverse hardware configurations.","8 Feb 2025 09:09:20","7 Mar 2025 06:38:11","Non-blind review","Demo","surendrab","Billa","","Surendra","surendrab@cdac.in","Centre For Development of Advanced Computing","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","surendrab","","Billa","","Surendra","Centre For Development of Advanced Computing","","","","","","surendrab@cdac.in","","Pune","Maharashtra","","IN","India","","Billa Surendra (Centre For Development of Advanced Computing)","surendrab@cdac.in","on","on","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJuwWXnQecY&t=1s&ab_channel=BillaSurendra","on","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

The techniques used in our research include merging multiple small instances of linear algebra kernels to expose more data-level parallelism (batching), redefining data structures, and rewriting loops to facilitate the vectorization done by the compiler. We highlight the portability of our solutions, making them architecture-agnostic which granted us performance speedups among different machines. We present speedups ranging from 6x to 30x in the RISC-V prototype, but also substantial speedups on an Intel supercomputer (Marenostrum4) and the NEC SX-Aurora architecture.","8 Feb 2025 11:11:56","8 Feb 2025 11:11:56","Non-blind review","","pvizcaino","Pablo","","Vizcaino","pablo.vizcaino@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","","Fabio","","Banchelli","fabio.banchelli@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","","David","","Jurado","david.jurado@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","","Marta","","Garcia-Gasulla","marta.garcia@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","","Filippo","","Mantovani","filippo.mantovani@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","pvizcaino","","Pablo","","Vizcaino","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","","","","","","pablo.vizcaino@bsc.es","","Barcelona","Barcelona","","ES","Spain","","Pablo Vizcaino (Barcelona Supercomputing Center); Fabio Banchelli (Barcelona Supercomputing Center); David Jurado (Barcelona Supercomputing Center); Marta Garcia-Gasulla (Barcelona Supercomputing Center); Filippo Mantovani (Barcelona Supercomputing Center)","pablo.vizcaino@bsc.es; fabio.banchelli@bsc.es; david.jurado@bsc.es; marta.garcia@bsc.es; filippo.mantovani@bsc.es","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Thus specialized interface solutions have emerged to address AI-specific challenges but suffer from limited adaptability and expandability. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose a flexible, open AI accelerator interface for the RISC-V architecture, natively supporting AI-oriented extensions—including vector, matrix, and tensor operations. The interface integrates diverse data access mechanisms—L1 cache access, bus access, coprocessor extension access, and inter-coprocessor data movement, to accommodate various AI dataflow scenarios. In addition, the interface provides a robust virtual memory mechanism that enables accelerators to obtain physical addresses from the processor via private TLBs or direct MMU access for efficient address translation. By supporting multiple decoupled microarchitectural designs through flexible accelerator decoding schemes and various accelerator CSR management approaches, the interface enhances system scalability, versatility, and performance. Together, these features form a scalable and robust solution for future AI accelerator applications based on RISC-V architectures.","8 Feb 2025 11:22:11","25 Apr 2025 09:11:32","Double-blind review","Poster","qiufucong","Fucong","","Qiu","qiufucong23s@ict.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","mjdac","Mingjin","","Gao","gaomingjin@ict.ac.cn","ICT","No","dantang","Dan","","Tang","tangdan21s@ict.ac.cn","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","No","baoyungang","Yungang","","Bao","baoyg@ict.ac.cn","ICT, CAS","No","","Tao","","Xie","taoxie@pku.edu.cn","Beijing Institute of Open Source Chip (BOSC)","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","qiufucong","","Fucong","","Qiu","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","","","","","","qiufucong23s@ict.ac.cn","","Beijing","Beijing","","CN","China","","Fucong Qiu (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences); Mingjin Gao (ICT); Dan Tang (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences); Yungang Bao (ICT, CAS); Tao Xie (Beijing Institute of Open Source Chip (BOSC))","qiufucong23s@ict.ac.cn; gaomingjin@ict.ac.cn; tangdan21s@ict.ac.cn; baoyg@ict.ac.cn; taoxie@pku.edu.cn","","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Compromise of the RoT can have catastrophic consequences, undermining the security of the entire system.

This paper presents OpenTitan Integrated, an open-source silicon RoT based on RISC-V specifically tailored for integration into the complex security subsystems of large SoCs. OpenTitan Integrated extends the functionality of the discrete OpenTitan implementation by addressing the specific needs of integrated deployments. Key contributions include: 1) a clear interface trust boundary, defining secure communication paths and preventing privilege escalation; 2) a robust and standardized communication interface, enabling seamless interaction with other SoC components; and 3) a flexible register isolation mechanism, protecting sensitive registers in the system from unauthorized access and modification. These additions enable secure interaction with other SoC components and prevent unauthorized access, enhancing the overall security posture of the SoC.

Furthermore, OpenTitan Integrated's open-source nature, available on GitHub under a permissive license, facilitates community review, independent verification, and enhances the overall security and trustworthiness of the design. This collaborative approach allows for rapid identification and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities, leading to a more robust and secure RoT.","8 Feb 2025 11:28:43","8 Feb 2025 11:56:39","Double-blind review","","rschilling-rivos","Robert","","Schilling","rschilling@rivosinc.com","Rivos Inc.","No","","Samuel","","Ortiz","sameo@rivosinc.com","Rivos Inc.","No","","Ravi","","Sahita","ravi@rivosinc.com","Rivos Inc.","No","","Andreas","","Kurth","andreas.kurth@opentitan.org","Lowrisc CIC","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","rschilling","","Robert","","Schilling","Rivos Inc","","","","","","rschilling@rivosinc.com","","","","","AT","Austria","","Robert Schilling (Rivos Inc.); Samuel Ortiz (Rivos Inc.); Ravi Sahita (Rivos Inc.); Andreas Kurth (Lowrisc CIC)","rschilling@rivosinc.com; sameo@rivosinc.com; ravi@rivosinc.com; andreas.kurth@opentitan.org","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","No","None","None",

Therefore, the optimization of base band signal processing kernels in conjunction with powerful hardware architectures have a crucial role in the performance, latency and power consumption of the LOW PHY (Physical Layer).

Efforts to enable RISC-V date to 2016, before physical hardware was available. At that time developers needed to run RISC-V on an FPGA or use emulation via software such as QEMU. Fedora contains tens of thousands of open source packages, many of which require architecture-specific code to perform optimally. The term ""porting"" here refers to building standard Fedora packages from their
upstream sources for RISC-V, without custom patches. Today, at the start of 2025, a range of development boards are available. Fedora made significant leaps in its RISC-V enablement. In Jan 2025, Fedora 41 images were released, just 2 months after the official architectures (x86, Arm, et al) launched. This talks aims to give an update on a few topics:

This paper investigates core issues in RISC-V education within China, including a shortage of skilled professionals, fragmented curriculum resources leading to low learning efficiency, scarcity of high-quality educational content, insufficient experimental equipment hindering programming capabilities growth, and a dispersed technical community with weak collaboration. To address these challenges, a systematic educational solution is proposed, encompassing tree dimensions: curriculum development, experiment environment support, and community engagement. In curriculum design, collaboration occurs with our laboratory, community developers, and university teachers to construct a multi-tiered course system spanning from foundational theories to cutting-edge technologies. A quality assurance mechanism is established through weekly technical seminars to form a course quality grading methodology ensuring continuous refinement of educational content. In order to address the challenge posed by hardware resource limitations, a strategy of integrating laboratory facilities across multiple regions in China has been adopted, with the aim of establishing a remote experimental environment that supports diverse RISC-V boards. This approach has the effect of significantly lowering barriers to RISC-V experimental environment access. Furthermore, an active community is cultivated, reaching over 30,000 participants through Bilibili and WeChat communities, regular offline technical workshops, and RISC-V programming competitions, fostering learner engagement and technical identity. The results demonstrate that this solution has produced over 1,000 original instructional videos, which have accumulated more than 1.3 million views. This systematic approach not only addresses critical educational gaps but also provides a scalable model for nurturing talent in emerging technologies, thereby accelerating the integration of RISC-V into innovation landscape.","21 Mar 2025 10:49:17","21 Mar 2025 10:49:17","Non-blind review","Poster","luoyunxiang","Yunxiang","","Luo","luoyunxiang@iscas.ac.cn","The Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","No","duoqilai","Fuyuan","","Zhang","zhangfuyuan@iscas.ac.cn","Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","luoyunxiang","","Yunxiang","","Luo","The Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)","","","","","","luoyunxiang@iscas.ac.cn","","Beijing","Beijing","","CN","China","","Yunxiang Luo (The Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)); Fuyuan Zhang (Programming Language and Compiler Technology Lab, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS))","luoyunxiang@iscas.ac.cn; zhangfuyuan@iscas.ac.cn","on","on","","","Extended_Abstract","Yes","None","None",

In this demonstration, we will show an out-of-order, superscalar RISC-V CHERI processor running on a DE10Pro FPGA board. This processor will run CheriBSD, which is a full-scale pure-capability operating system derived from FreeBSD. The core piece of our demonstration is fast and fine-grained compartmentalisation. For this demonstration, we use library compartmentalisation, which places each library in its own compartment mitigating dangerous security threats. We will show a small example demonstrating the security benefits of fine-grained CHERI compartmentalisation. We aim to extend this demonstration to a larger software corpus, e.g., running a compartmentalised nginx server.

In the application video, we run the experiments on a DE10Pro FPGA board connected to a server for convenience and filming reasons, e.g., noise produced by a running FPGA.","21 Mar 2025 12:57:58","21 Mar 2025 12:57:58","Non-blind review","Demo","faf28","Franz","","Fuchs","franz.fuchs@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","Peter","","Rugg","peter.rugg@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","Dapeng","","Gao","dapeng.gao@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","jonathan.woodruff","Jonathan","","Woodruff","jonathan.woodruff@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","Alexandre","","Joannou","alexandre.joannou@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","Robert","","Watson","robert.watson@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","Simon","","Moore","simon.moore@cl.cam.ac.uk","University of Cambridge","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","faf28","","Franz","A.","Fuchs","University of Cambridge","","","","","","franz.fuchs@cl.cam.ac.uk","","","","","GB","United Kingdom","","Franz A.

While significant progress has been made in RISC-V processor and software development, the ability to flexibly connect multiple nodes with shared, coherent memory remains a challenge.
Our demo addresses this critical need by introducing a working prototype of an OmniXtend-based open coherent memory fabric for RISC-V platforms. Built on standard Ethernet infrastructure, this system enables memory disaggregation, pooling, and sharing between multiple RISC-V nodes while preserving cache coherence. The underlying fabric controller is implemented on FPGA and communicates with a RISC-V SoC, demonstrating a practical path toward open, composable system architectures.

The live demonstration includes:
1. Random memory access patterns issued from the RISC-V processor to remote memory over OmniXtend links.
2. Memory pooling across nodes, where distributed memory resources are presented as a unified coherent address space.
3. Benchmark evaluation to showcase system-level performance, latency, and bandwidth of the fabric under realistic workloads.

Through this demo, we emphasize our contribution in addressing one of the RISC-V ecosystem's most pressing needs — a robust, open, and scalable memory interconnect — and demonstrate how OmniXtend over Ethernet can serve as a cost-effective and flexible solution for future data-centric RISC-V systems.","18 Apr 2025 00:14:30","18 Apr 2025 00:14:30","Non-blind review","Demo","seungjunn","Seung-Jun","","Cha","seungjunn@etri.re.kr","ETRI","No","","Hyuk Je","","Kwon","heavenwing@etri.re.kr","ETRI","No","","Young Woo","","Kim","bartmann@etri.re.kr","ETRI","No","","Song-woo","","Sok","swsok@etri.re.kr","ETRI","No","","Jinmee","","Kim","jinmee@etri.re.kr","ETRI","No","","Hag Young","","Kim","h0kim@etri.re.kr","ETRI","No","","Kwang-Won","","Koh","kwangwon.koh@etri.re.kr","ETRI","No","","Kang Ho","","Kim","khk@etri.re.kr","ETRI","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","seungjunn","","Seung-Jun","","Cha","ETRI","","","","","","seungjunn@etri.re.kr","","Daejeon","","","KR","Republic of Korea","","Seung-Jun Cha (ETRI); Hyuk Je Kwon (ETRI); Young Woo Kim (ETRI); Song-woo Sok (ETRI); Jinmee Kim (ETRI); Hag Young Kim (ETRI); Kwang-Won Koh (ETRI); Kang Ho Kim (ETRI)","seungjunn@etri.re.kr; heavenwing@etri.re.kr; bartmann@etri.re.kr; swsok@etri.re.kr; jinmee@etri.re.kr; h0kim@etri.re.kr; kwangwon.koh@etri.re.kr; khk@etri.re.kr","","","https://youtu.be/gmlrR3m0sM0","on","","No","None","None",

One of our key achievements is the successful porting of ROCm to RISC-V. This involved adapting toolchains, patching kernel interfaces, and getting the GPU drivers to work reliably on the RISC-V platform.

This demo is a proof of concept that RISC-V systems can run cutting-edge LLMs using open tools、open models and commodity hardware with open software stack.

"250","250X-A6J5B5P9D5","Spike-RTL: quasi-cycle accuracy hardware/software co-simulation","Raul Gomez-Varela, Hector Posadas and Eugenio Villar","RISC-V Univesity Demo Day","Christian Fabre","Accept (Demo)","","The demo proposed is based on the demonstration of the Spike-RTL tool, which is currently under development by the University of Cantabria.

The Spike-RTL tool is designed to simulate RISC-V systems by combining the fast execution of an Instruction Set Simulator (ISS), specifically Spike, with the detailed and cycle-accurate simulation of Verilog code, using Verilator. This hybrid approach brings significant performance benefits while maintaining precision.

On the one hand, the simulation avoids executing the Verilog code corresponding to the processor/memory subsystem, which represents a large portion of the RTL code and the associated simulation overhead. This is possible because the subsystem relies on standard processors and memories that can be effectively simulated using Spike.

On the other hand, integrating Spike with the Verilog simulation of the remaining platform components enables full software development, execution, and debugging in an environment that accurately replicates the behavior of the real hardware, from application code to platform-specific software interactions.

The submitted brief demo video showcases this infrastructure with a basic example: combining Spike with a modified version of the Verilog code of the X-HEEP platform, where the processor/memory subsystem is removed and replaced by an interface to Spike. The example demonstrates a simple application that interacts with the GPIO peripheral to read input data and, based on its value, activates two output lines, which correspond to two LEDs on the final hardware. The system uses interrupts to detect changes on the GPIO input and visualizes the results using waveform signals. These waveforms show the input values injected via the testbench (GPIO[15:8]) and the output responses (GPIO[17:16]), as well as internal GPIO behavior such as interrupt lines and bus transactions.

The final version of the demonstration to be presented during the Summit will be based on a more realistic, complex application. This application will include the use of additional X-HEEP peripherals and bidirectional communication between Verilog and Spike, as a consequence of the use of platform's integrated DMA for internal data transfers.","25 Apr 2025 16:31:30","25 Apr 2025 20:59:06","Non-blind review","Demo","raulgomezvarela","Raul","","Gomez-Varela","raulgv@teisa.unican.es","University of Cantabria","No","posadash","Hector","","Posadas","posadash@teisa.unican.es","Universidad de Cantabria","No","evillar","Eugenio","","Villar","villar@teisa.unican.es","University of Cantabria","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","raulgomezvarela","","Raul","","Gomez-Varela","University of Cantabria","","","","","","raulgv@teisa.unican.es","","Santander","Cantabria","","ES","Spain","","Raul Gomez-Varela (University of Cantabria); Hector Posadas (Universidad de Cantabria); Eugenio Villar (University of Cantabria)","raulgv@teisa.unican.es; posadash@teisa.unican.es; villar@teisa.unican.es","","","https://unican-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/gomezvarelar_unican_es/EavwsjuCmTlLrpAXMJh8GpgBRdXwIVKa8ySysF_AY_kZNg?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=zaKaa6","on","","No","None","None",

Systolic arrays are an effective hardware architecture for enhancing the performance of TinyML applications. They are particularly useful for matrix multiplication, a fundamental operation in TinyML workloads.

This demo shows a configurable, RISC-V compatible systolic array architecture built using CFU Playground. CFU Playground is a platform that enables custom hardware accelerators to function as co-processors for a RISC-V host core. We demonstrate matrix multiplication acceleration on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA using an Arty A7-100T development board. Our systolic arrays run at 100 MHz. The 3×3 array uses 14% of the FPGA's DSP blocks and 24% of its LUTs. The 10×10 array uses 100% of the DSP blocks and 37% of the LUTs.

Our experimental results show that the systolic arrays improve execution performance by 2.7x and 9x compared to software-only implementations. They also reduce energy consumption by 120x and 40x, respectively. Our demo highlights how systolic array hardware accelerators can improve TinyML performance and energy efficiency on resource-limited RISC-V platforms.","25 Apr 2025 20:17:20","25 Apr 2025 20:17:20","Non-blind review","Demo","mardinio","Omar","","Mardini","ojm04@mail.aub.edu","American University of Beirut","No","omarshibli","Omar","","Shibli","ois02@mail.aub.edu","American University of Beirut","No","mazen","Mazen","","Saghir","mazen@aub.edu.lb","American University of Beirut","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","mazen","","Mazen","","Saghir","American University of Beirut","","","","","","mazen@aub.edu.lb","","Beirut","Beirut","","LB","Lebanon","","Omar Mardini (American University of Beirut); Omar Shibli (American University of Beirut); Mazen Saghir (American University of Beirut)","ojm04@mail.aub.edu; ois02@mail.aub.edu; mazen@aub.edu.lb","","","https://mailaub-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mazen_aub_edu_lb/EWL0pUw98JlLg6L8T1VJNMMB7fMYXnyMr4M2mWHW3ovkxA?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=u97MeC","on","","No","None","None",

The METASAT project (https://metasat-project.eu/), funded by the European Union's Horizon Europe programme, finished in December 2024. The project focused on the development of a revolutionary hardware and software concepts for future space systems.

Barcelona Supercomputing Center was coordinating the project and the main contributor of hardware platform, the low level software stack and AI applications, all of which are included in our demonstrator. No contribution from the non-academic project partners is used in our demo submission.

In particular, at BSC we developed the METASAT hardware platform, which includes a multicore NOEL-V processor integrated with our custom SIMD unit, SPARROW, and the RISC-V based VORTEX GPU. The platform is prototyped on an FPGA as well as on the QEMU emulator.

We also developed three AI space applications of varying criticality that run in parallel on the platform: cloud screening and ship detection (as lower-criticality payload tasks), and a Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) application that detects anomalies in satellite camera temperature data, trained on real mission data provided by the German Space Agency.

The demo will showcase a streamlined version of the final METASAT demonstrator. In the linked video, you can see an early version running in our (noisy) server room where our FPGA is located. On the left is the Xilinx VCU118 FPGA board which instantiates our METASAT SoC implementation. Its output is provided through UART to a laptop computer which plays the role of EGSE (Electrical Ground Support Equipment), i.e. emulating the satellite connections, and receiving telecommands and displaying telemetry data.

The relevant interesting output of our demonstrator consists of the visualisation of the inference results of our AI applications. In particular, we can see at 0:14 the original satellite image on the left and the detection of the pixels
covered by clouds on the right. At 0:19 we can see the original satellite image on the left and the detected ship on the right, within its computed bounding box. Finally 0:24 displays the plots of the satellite health data from the
(emulated) temperature sensors (orange), as well as the prediction of the health curves (blue), showing the detected anomalies when the two lines are not overlapping.

The AI applications are executed in parallel, and can use both the SPARROW accelerator and the GPU. Therefore, not only they can be executed faster than their scalar versions, but they can also timeshare the accelerator and the GPU.","25 Apr 2025 21:20:13","25 Apr 2025 21:20:13","Non-blind review","Demo","marcsb","Marc","","Solé Bonet","marc.solebonet@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)","No","janniswolf","Jannis","","Wolf","wolf.jannis@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center","No","mtrompou","Matina Maria","","Trompouki","matina.trompouki@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)","No","lkosmid","Leonidas","","Kosmidis","leonidas.kosmidis@bsc.es","Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) and Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya (UPC)","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","lkosmid","","Leonidas","","Kosmidis","Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) and Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya (UPC)","","","+34 603158764","","","leonidas.kosmidis@bsc.es","","Barcelona","Barcelona","","ES","Spain","","Marc Solé Bonet (Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)); Jannis Wolf (Barcelona Supercomputing Center); Matina Maria Trompouki (Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)); Leonidas Kosmidis (Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) and Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya (UPC))","marc.solebonet@bsc.es; wolf.jannis@bsc.es; matina.trompouki@bsc.es; leonidas.kosmidis@bsc.es","","","https://youtu.be/VRV5-U91yVk","on","","No","None","None",
"254","254X-E3H2H2A6J5","Enabling Security for Alexa Voice Services on RISC-V platforms with OP-TEE","Marouene Boubakri","RISC-V Univesity Demo Day","Christian Fabre","Reject (Demo)","","In prior work, I successfully ported OP-TEE to the RISC-V architecture, establishing the first trusted operating system available for RISC-V software ecosystem and platforms. Following this milestone, I assumed the role of official maintainer for OP-TEE RISC-V within the community. Since then, numerous companies have begun adopting and contributing to the RISC-V OP-TEE, further validating its importance and accelerating its industrial adoption. To showcase a concrete use case of this trusted execution framework, I ported the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) to RISC-V platforms. To address the security requirements mandated by AVS, I further proposed a security implementation based OP-TEE PKCS#11 TA as a Hardware Security Module (HSM).

According to Amazon's Alexa Voice Service (AVS) security requirements, devices are mandated to use a chipset that incorporates hardware-based security capabilities and meets the standards of PSA Certified Level 1 or an equivalent certification. 

To ensure the protection of sensitive information, the AVS Device SDK employs AES-GCM encryption. According to the security requirements, managing the main encryption key via an HSM is crucial to prevent its access outside the SDK configuration. The AVS SDK utilizes the PKCS#11 interface for accessing the HSM. In the PKCS#11 interface. 

Porting OP-TEE to RISC-V enabled the seamless reuse of existing Trusted Applications (TAs), including the widely adopted PKCS#11 TA, thereby accelerating the development of secure services on RISC-V platforms.","25 Apr 2025 21:30:20","25 Apr 2025 21:30:20","Non-blind review","Demo","","Marouene","","Boubakri","maroueneboubakri@gmail.com","University of Carthage / NXP","No","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","maro","","Marouene","","Boubakri","Mediatron Lab, Higher School of Communications of Tunis, University of Carthage, Tunisia","","","","","","maroueneboubakri@gmail.com","","Tunis","NA","","FR","France","","Marouene Boubakri (University of Carthage / NXP)","maroueneboubakri@gmail.com","","","https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hqo7_VQevCxvB2Y07e_WDcA9n8Py0YVp?usp=sharing","on","","No","None","None",

We demonstrate the entire process running on an affordable ($300) Arty A7 FPGA platform, loading the xv6 OS from an SD card using a custom zero-stage bootloader. Key technical aspects highlighted include hardware initialization (UART, SPI), memory mapping, robust error handling, and the simulation/emulation workflow (using ModelSim, with work towards Verilator).  

We have successfully booted the xv6 kernel to its initial messages, proving the feasibility of bringing up a full OS stack on accessible hardware. This project provides valuable hands-on experience across hardware and software, offering insights into bridging the hardware-software interface and managing FPGA resource constraints.
