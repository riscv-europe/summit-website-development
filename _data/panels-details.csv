2000,OkToPublish,Catalysing a new era of European computing innovation with RISC-V,"RISC-V is driving new waves of local innovation on a worldwide scale with companies and countries using its open and flexible nature to create new products, solutions and initiatives customized to their local needs, that they can also sell on to a worldwide market. This panel will explore how we can make the most of the opportunity for Europe, how RISC-V can catalyse new businesses and initiatives, the opportunities available, and what problems need to be solved to maximize their chances of success.",Trina Watt,,Rivos,**Russel Haggar** (Silicon Catalyst). **Yuniung Liang** (DeepComputing). **Roger Espasa** (Semidynamics),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2001,OkToPublish,Accelerating Automotive Innovation with RISC-V: The journey from early adoption to industry wide deployment,"The Automotive industry is already adopting RISC-V to deliver the vehicles of tomorrow, based on its open nature, ability to scale across all types of in-vehicle compute, and the support and supply options given by its global ecosystem of members. In this panel we will discuss how we can accelerate the momentum of RISC-V in automotive, the benefits of using an open standard, how we can ensure quality, safety and security required by automotive, the priorities we need to work on together and how we can build a software ecosystem together to deliver future automotive innovation.

2002,OkToPublish,Enterprise Linux Enablement on RISC-V ,"While building an open ISA is revolutionizing silicon development across Europe and the world at large, it needs to work hand in hand with the software ecosystem for it to be truly impactful in the marketplace. Europe is home to several centers of excellence within the Linux software distribution space. SUSE is based in the heart of Europe. Canonical too has it’s headquarters there. While Red Hat has its largest global engineering base in Brno, Česká republika. In essence a major portion of Open Source software development is driven from within the confines of Europe. Each of the major Enterprise Linux Distributions is investing in the enablement of the RISC-V platform, in essence collaborating in joint upstream development. Open Source is all about community where competitors collaborate to enable the future of tomorrow. Here is our chance to hear directly from the major Enterprise Distributions about their investment into this new and exciting future of the RISC-V software ecosystem which will drive technological innovation for decades to come.",Isaac Chute,Director of Software Ecosystem,RISC-V International,"**Gordan Markuš** (Director Silicon Alliances, Canonical). **Barna Ibrahim** (Vice-Chair, RISE).  **Matthias G.
